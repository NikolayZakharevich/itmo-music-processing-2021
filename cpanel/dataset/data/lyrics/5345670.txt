Wake to see, your true emancipation
Is a fantasy.
Policies have risen up and overcome the brave.
Greatness dies, unsung and lost,
Invisible to history.
Embedded spies, brainwashing our
Children to be mean.

You don’t have long
I am on to you.
The time, it has come to destroy
Your supremacy.

You don’t have long
I am on to you.
The time, it has come to destroy
Your supremacy.
