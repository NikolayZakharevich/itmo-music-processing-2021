That’s how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out
And if it’s crowded, all the better
Because we know we’re gonna be up late
But if you’re worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, you’re talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age
And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And if the sun comes up and I still don’t wanna stagger home
Then it’s the memory of our betters
That’s keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You’re talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except the part
Where the moral kicks in
And when we’re running out of the drugs
And the conversation’s grinding away
I wouldn’t trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You’re talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
If I could be with my friends tonight
