Papa, why do you play all the same old songs 
Why do you sing with the melody 
Cause down on the street somethings goin' on 
There's a new beat and a brand new song 

He said 
In my life, there was so much anger 
Still I have no regrets 
Just like you, I was such a rebel 
So dance your own dance, and never forget 

N'oubliez jamais 
I heard my father say 
Every generation has its way 
A need to disobey 

N'oubliez jamais 
It's in your destiny 
A need to disagree 
When rules get in the way 
N'oubliez jamais 

Mamma, why do you dance to the same old songs
Why do you sing only the harmony 
Down on the street something's goin' on 
There's a new beat and a brand new song 

She said 
In my heart there's a young girl's passion 
For a life long duet 
Someday soon someone's smile will haunt you 
So sing your own song and never forget 

N'oubliez jamais 
I heard my father say 
Every generation has its way 
A need to disobey 

N'oubliez jamais 
It's in your destiny 
A need to disagree 
When rules get in the way 
N'oubliez jamais 

What is this game 
Searching for love or fame, it's all the same 
One of these days you say that love will be the cure 
I'm not sure 

N'oubliez jamais 
I heard my father say 
Every generation has its way 
A need to disobey 

N'oubliez jamais 
It's in your destiny 
A need to disagree 
When rules get in the way 
N'oubliez jamais
