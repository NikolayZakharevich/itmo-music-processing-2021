The wind is a-whippin' through the open doors
Speakin' of the sea and the rolling waves
Maybe there's a ship at the bottom now
Or struggling on the surface with a cry for help
Wish I could forget and let the years go by
Wish I could escape from my dreams of you

Twenty years ago 'twas a howlin' storm
As the voice of a God from a great beyond
I was standing on the shore as the sky grew dark
With a hand on a bible and a hand on my heart
Wish I could forget and let the years go by
Wish I could escape from my dreams of you

Because all I have left is the voice of the wind
Blowing through the doors of our house

The sun was dryin' up the rainy skies
Shining gold in our sails and our hearts standing by
Remember what they're singin' on their way to the sea
"Goodbye, fare thee well, goodbye for me"
Wish I could forget and let the years go by

Wish I could escape from my dreams of you

Empty were the coffins and the house where we lived
As the grave that I dug by our place on the beach
How I wish the water could be poured out of the sea
So I can go and get you back ashore with me
Wish I could forget and let the years go by
Wish I could escape from my dreams of you

Because all I have left is the voice of the wind
Blowing through the doors
Because all I have left is the voice of the wind
Blowing through the doors

One more time

All I have left is the voice of the wind
Blowing through the doors of our house
