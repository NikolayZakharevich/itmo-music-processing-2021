I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space

And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little
It looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
There was something so pleasant about that place
