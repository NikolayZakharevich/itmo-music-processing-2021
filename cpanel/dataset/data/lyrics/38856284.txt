Take a seat
Right over there
Sat on the stairs
 
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare
And I'm unaware
 
Of just how we got,
into this mess
Got so aggressive
 
I know we meant
All good intentions
 
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
 
Take a step
Back for a minute
Into the kitchen
 
Floors are wet
Taps are still running
Dishes are broken
 
How did we get,
into this mess
Got so aggressive
 
I know we meant
All good intentions
 
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close
Why don't you come on over
Cos I can't just let you go
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
 
Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection
 
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just...
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
 
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle
In the middle
In the middle
