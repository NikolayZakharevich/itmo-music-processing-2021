Shame on you for thinking
You’re an exception
We’re all to blame
Crashing down to earth
Wasting and burning out
Fading like a dead star
One is coming your way
Its coming your way
And you used to mean everything to me And now your tired of fighting
Tired of fighting, burning up She’ll know me for thinking
Your all alone
If you want it you should learn
Fading to the ground
Why can’t you sleep with
Someone who’ll protect you
One is coming your way
Its coming your way
And you used to mean everything to me And now your tired of fighting
Tired of fighting, burning up
