I just wanna take you there
He don’t gotta go nowhere
Does he touch you here like this
Lemme take the friction from your lips
(Bridge)
And I’ma love you girl
The way you need
Ain’t no one will stop us
Ain’t no one will stop us
And I’ma give you girl
Oh what you fiend
I’m the drug in your veins
Just fight through the pain
(Chorus)
He’s what you want x4
I’m what you need
What you need
What you need
I’m What you need
What you need
What you need
He’s what you want x4
I’m what you need
What you need
What you need
I’m what you need
What you need
What you need
(Verse 2)
Ive got everything you want with me
Ill do everything he does times three
And he dont gotta know
I got you on the floor
Doing things you’ve neva thought you’d do
Baby leave the high heel shoes
Cuz i love it when you looking down on me
Lookin' up at you
And I dont give a damn shorty
Watch me knock your boots off
(Bridge)
(Chorus)
