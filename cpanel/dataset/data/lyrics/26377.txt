For once, there’s someone for he, for she.
For once, there’s someone for he, for me.
(T&M:)
Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people’s plans
I’ll be here for my baby, for my baby I’ll be here
So many things I need to tell you, things you need to hear
It was a day like no other
Clocks
It was said they dropped the bomb
And I walked out the door
Feeling lonely,
Thinking of what was once
So I go in search of people
the inhabitants
The air is filled with chemicals
So this is the aftermath
Walking over rubble
Which was once
Down to the center
Which used to be central
So this is the aftermath
For once, there’s someone for he, for she.
For once, there’s someone for he, for me.

Your eyes resemble mine, you see as no others can
Here inherit my kingdom, speak of our people’s plan
I’ll be here for my baby, for my baby I’ll be near
So many things I need to tell you, things you need to hear
For once, there’s someone for he, for she.
For once, there’s someone for he, for me.
«How can I
«How can I How can I be sure
In a world that’s constantly changing
How can I be sure
Just when I thought I was winning
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
Just when I thought I was winning
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
How can I be sure
