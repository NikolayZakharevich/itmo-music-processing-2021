You come around and make the seasons change
You come around and leave the way you came
You come around and wipe my tears away
You make me wanna give my heart away
The way you speak, it leaves me without words
And when you’re gone it makes me toss and turn
You come around and make sure that it hurts
You make sure that it hurts when you’re away
Here among the clouds
We are safe and sound
You lift me up
You lift me up
You come around and light up everything
You stun me with your smile and all you bring
You come around and make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing my fears away
Here among the clouds
We are safe and sound
You lift me up
You lift me up
You lift me up
You lift me up
You lift me up
