There’s an old tale wrought with mystery, of Tom the Poet and his muse
And a magic lake which gave a life to the words
the poet used
Now, the muse she was his happiness, and he rhymed about her grace
And told her stories of treasures deep beneath the
blackened waves
Till' in the stillness of one dawn, still in its misty
crown
The muse she went down to the lake, and in the
waves she drowned
And now to see your love set free
You will need the witch 's cabin key
Find the lady of the light, gone mad with the night
That’s how you reshape destiny
The poet came down to the lake to call out to his
dear
When there was no answer he was overcome
with fear
He searched in vain for his treasure lost and too
soon the night would fall
Only his own echo would wail back at his call
And when he swore to bring back his love by stories he’d create
Nightmares shifted in their sleep in the darkness
of the lake
And now to see your love set free
You will need the witch 's cabin key
Find the lady of the light, still raving in the night
That’s how you reshape destiny
In the dead of night she came to him with
darkness in her eyes
Wearing a mourning gown, sweet words as her
disguise
He took her in without a word for he saw his
grave mistake
And vowed them both to silence deep beneath
the lake
Now, if it’s real or just a dream one mystery
remains
For it is said, on moonless nights they may still
haunt this place
