Look, listen to my voice,
If you're making the choice
Tell to all the girls and the boys
Either scream or rejoice.
Let's make that noise,
Either move or we will all be destroyed.

Move and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do.
Move when you just can't take it
And move if you just feel like breaking it.

Can you hear me?
Stop, look, listen to my voice.
It was never my choice to feel all alone,
This is my home.
Back up, you don't know if you've never been here,
You've never been to the place inside.
I face my fears,
It takes everything I am.

Move and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do.
Move when you just can't take it
And move if you just feel like breaking it. 

Move and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do.
Move when you just can't take it
And move if you just feel like breaking it.

If you come near me,
Stop, look, listen to my voice.
If you're making the choice
Tell all the girls and the boys
Either scream or rejoice.
Let's make that noise,
Either move or we will all be destroyed.
Back up and let's go if you've never been here,
You've never been to the place inside.
I face my fears,
It takes everything I am.

Move and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do.
Move when you just can't take it
And move if you just feel like breaking it.

Move and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do.
Move when you just can't take it
And move if you just feel like breaking it.

I come crashing to the floor,
And I know there must be more like me.
I've seen this all before,
I can't carry this anymore.
Break free, breathe and leave until the storm is over
'Cause underneath there's a diamond passing over.
So breath, let's leave until the storm is over,
Because I want to take you away.

Move and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do.
Move when you just can't take it
And move if you just feel like breaking it. 

Move and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do.
Move when you just can't take it
And move if you just feel like breaking it.

Move and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do.
Move when you just can't take it
And move if you just feel like breaking it.

Move and show me what you can do
When you step into the circle and shake like we do.
Move when you just can't take it
And move if you just feel like breaking it.
