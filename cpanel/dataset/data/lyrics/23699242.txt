All that I had is gone
And the sad songs know how I feel
Your kind of love was never enough
To brighten the melodies

All that I have is gone
Packed my bags and just disappeared
And I search for the street
where we used to meet
To find you again my dear

There's somebody
who'll be there as I break
Be the blood in my veins as I sing
When I hear the sound
of the underground
It will bring you back to me

All that I had is here
I would sing and there you would be
In the heat of the night,
there you left my side
Now London has started to freeze

All that I want is here
I will drink and there you will be
There's a space in a bar
and a brand new star
If I can standon my own two feet

There's somebody
who'll be there as I break
Be the blood in my veins as I sing
When I hear the sound
of the underground
It will bring you back to me

I'll smoke a cigarette
and toast the dead
All I can see is your fuckery
Exactly like you said

There's somebody
who'll be there as I break
Be the blood in my veins as I sing
When I hear the sound
of the underground
It will bring you back to me

It will bring you back to me
