Sunny, yesterday my life
Was filled with rain.
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain.
Now the dark days are gone, and the bright days are here,
My Sunny one shines so sincere.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet.
Sunny, thank you for the love you on my way.
You gave to me your all and all.
And now I feel ten feet tall.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the truth
You let me see.
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z.
My life was torn like a windblown sand,
And the rock was formed
When you held it hand.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, thank you for the smile upon your face.
Sunny, thank you for the gleam
That shows its grace.
You’re my spark of the nature’s fire,
You’re my sweet complete desire.
Sunny one so true, yes, I love you.

Sunny, yesterday all my life
Was filled with rain.
Sunny, you smiled at me and really really eased the pain.
Now the dark days are gone, and the bright days are here,
My Sunny one shines so sincere.
Sunny one so true, I love you.
