Would you lie if I asked you
Close your eyes if you have to
For reasons I can’t explain
I’m here still
Run and hide when I have to
Wanting more, but I want you
Terrified I can’t go through
The space between us two
Don’t leave just yet
Dance with me love one last time, slowly
Drown me again, just like you did
One last time, lovely
Phantom you lay, across my bed one last time
If only, for a moment we could
Not too sure that I know you
Think you left when I left you
And now were fading away
Drifting as we end our stay
Don’t leave just yet
Dance with me love one last time, slowly
Drown me again, just like you did
One last time, lovely
Phantom you lay, across my bed one last time
If only, for a moment we could
