Do you hear me father Bamba
Did they hear you father Bamba
The man in me changes everytime I read you «Khassayids»
My strong faith in you makes me survive this crazy world
Now I can go anywhere, because I know you’ll be there
We know your pain will always make us stronger
Mame Bamba
«Khassayid»
You are our rescuer
Every day, every night, every moment
They are singing and they are crying
You may be gone but your spirit will remain
Oh it will stay until the end of time
