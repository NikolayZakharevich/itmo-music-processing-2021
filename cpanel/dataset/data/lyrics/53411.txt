Polly wants a cracker
Think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

Isn't me
Have a seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Don't cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Got some rope
Have been told
Promise you
Have been true
Let me take a ride
Don't cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself

Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

Isn't me
Have a seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Don't cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
I've got some rope
Have been told
I promise you
Have been true
Let me take a ride
Don't cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself

Polly says her back hurts
And she's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me, the will of instinct

Isn't me
Have a seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Don't cut yourself
Want some help
Please myself
Got some rope
Have been told
Promise you
Have been true
Let me take a ride
Don't cut yourself
I want some help
Please myself
