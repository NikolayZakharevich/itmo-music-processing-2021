You have to swear
You’ve got love to love me Aah Aah
That will last forever
Aah Aah
We must have a story
Aah Aah
With a happy ending
So don’t ever go away
And never put aside
The things i’m gonna say
Cause these are the rules for us Use your eyes
Only to look at me Use your mouth
Only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh
Only if you laugh with me You can cry
Only if you cry for me Don’t forget that you’re condemned to me Oh can’t you see
You always were
You’ll always be You used to say
I should see a doctor
Aah Aah
Who would keep me busy
Aah Aah
Cause a jealous woman
never makes it easy
AAh, aah
And you know I’ll do for us Whatever seems right
But I may take awhile
Before I change the rules
Use your eyes
Only to look at me Use your mouth
Only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh
Only if you laugh with me You can cry
Only if you cry for me Don’t forget that you’re condemned to me Oh cant you see
You always wereeeee
You always wereee
Aaah aah ah So Use your eyes
Only to look at me Use your mouth
Only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh
Only if you laugh with me You can cry
Only if you cry for me Don’t forget that you’re condemned to me Oh cant you see
You always wereeeee
You always beeee
Aaah aah ah aaaaahhh
