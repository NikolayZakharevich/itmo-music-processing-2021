Hope is all that we have
With each birth, every tear, we have hope, we have hope

Speck of gold in your heart
Everyone, everyone
Speck of gold in your heart
Every sun, everyone

Speck of gold

Cold, cold ways, I won't
Hold you heart to this light
One and all, one and all
Speck of gold
Speck of gold, that we just unfolded

Love your heart, love your heart
Speck of gold, everyone hold our sun
Wanna live

Speck of gold

Speck of dust on our sun
Shade our world, shade our world
Speck of dust on everyone
Save our sun, save our world

Speck of dust on our sun
Shade our world, shade our world
Speck of dust on everyone
Save our sun, save our world
