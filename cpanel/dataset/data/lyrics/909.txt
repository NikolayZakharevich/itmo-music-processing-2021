I never thought that I could be so bold,
to even say these thoughts aloud.
I see you with your man, your eyes just shine,
while he stands tall and walking proud.
That look you give that guy, I wanna see…
Looking right at me.
If I could be that guy, instead of me…
I’d never let you down.
It always seems like you’re going somewhere,
better than you’ve been before.
Well I go to sleep, and I dream all night,
of you knocking on my door.
That look you give that guy, I wanna see…
Looking right at me.
If I could be that guy, instead of me…
I’d be all I can be. I’d be all I can be.
I’m nothing like what I’d like to be
I’m nothing much i know it’s true
I lack the style in the pedigree
And my chances are so few
That look you give that guy, I wanna see…
Looking right at me.
If I could be that guy, instead of me…
I’d give you all I got.
I never thought that I could be so bold,
to even say these thoughts aloud.
But if let’s say, it won’t work out.
You know where I can be found.
That look you give that guy, I wanna see…
Looking right at me.
If I could be that guy, instead of me…
I’d never let you down. I’d never let you down.
