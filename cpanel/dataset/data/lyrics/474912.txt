Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings for too long
Controlling my feelings far too long
Controlling my feelings far too long
Forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And pushing us into self destruction
Pushing us into self destruction
They make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams
Trying to please you far too long
Trying to please you far too long
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
Visions of greed you wallow
They make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams
Controlling my feelings far too long
Controlling my feelings far too long
And forcing my darkest souls to unfold
And forcing our darkest souls to unfold
And pushing us into self destruction
And pushing us into self destruction
They make me
Make me dream your dreams
And they make me
Make me scream your screams
