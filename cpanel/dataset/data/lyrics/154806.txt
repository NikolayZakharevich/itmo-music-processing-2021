Everybody sees some changes
Everybody sheds a skin or two
You won't recognize me
When I get over you

Unattended dreams will breathe life
All my wishes will come true
And there'll be time for everything
When I get over you

When I get over you
The sky will still be blue
And I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you

I'm setting free the monkey
I'm setting free the lions too
Yesterday's child will grow up wild
When I get over you

When I get over you
The sky will still be blue
And I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you

I'll be wearing a fairy-tale
I'll walk in glass high-heeled shoes
And there'll be a moral to the story
When I get over you

I'll be the life of the party
I'll misbehave and act the fool
I won't care who knows me
When I get over you

When I get over you
The sky will still be blue
And I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you

When I get over you
Yeah
The skies will still be blue
I said I'll swim there if I want to
When I get over you...
