When I look into your eyes,
It's like watching the night sky,
Or a beautiful sunrise.
There's so much they hold.

And just like them old stars,
I see that you've come so far,
To be right where you are.
How old is your soul?

I won't give up on us,
Even if the skies get rough.
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking up.

And when you're needing your space,
To do some navigating,
I'll be here patiently waiting,
To see what you find.

Cause even the stars they burn,
Some even fall to the earth.
We've got a lot to learn.
God knows we're worth it.
No, I won't give up.

I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily.
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make.

Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to
Use the tools and gifts we got.
Yeah, we got a lot at stake.

And in the end you're still my friend.
At least we did intend for us to work.
We didn't break.
We didn't burn.
We had to learn, how to bend, without the world, caving in.
I had to learn, what I've got, and what I'm not,
And who I am.

I won't give up on us,
Even if the skies get rough.
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking up.
I'm still looking up.

I won't give up on us. (No, I'm not giving up.)
God knows I'm tough enough. (I am tough. I am love.)
We've got a lot to learn. (We're life. We are love.)
God knows we're worth it. (And we're worth it.)

I won't give up on us,
Even if the skies get rough.
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking up.
