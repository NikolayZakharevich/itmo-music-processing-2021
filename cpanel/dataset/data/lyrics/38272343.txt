Often I am upset that I cannot fall in love
But I guess this avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you-you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now, but I swear
When I'm ready, I will fly us out of here

Cut-cut hair, leave
I'll cut my hair
Cut-cut hair
Place, but strangely he feels at home in this place
But strangely he feels at home in this

Often I am upset that I cannot fall in love
But I guess this avoids the stress of falling out of it
Are you-you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now, but I swear
When I'm ready, I will fly us out of here

Cut-cut hair, leave
I'll cut my hair
Cut-cut hair
Place, but strangely he feels at home in this place
But strangely he feels at home in this
