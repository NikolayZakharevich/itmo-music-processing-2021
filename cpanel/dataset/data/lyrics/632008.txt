I keep on fallin' in
And out with you
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes you make me feel blue
Sometimes I feel good
At times I feel used
Loving you darlin'
Makes me so confused

I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you

Oh, oh
I never felt this way
How do you give me
So much pleasure
And cause me so much pain?
And just when I think
I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin'
Back in love with you

I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you

Oh baby I
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
I'm fallin'
Fallin'

I keep on fallin'
In and out (out) of love (love) with you (with you)
I never (never) loved someone (loved)
The way that I'm (I) lovin' you

I'm fallin' in and out of love (of love)
With you (with you)
I never (no) loved someone (no no)
The way that I'm (uh) lovin' you

I'm fallin' in and out of love (of love)
With you (with you)
I never (no) loved someone (no no)
The way that I'm (uh) lovin' you
