Dum-dum-dum-dumby-doo-wah
Ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-wah
Only the lonely
Only the lonely

Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumby-doo-wah)

Know the way I feel tonight (ooh-yay-yay-yay-yeah)
Only the lonely (dum-dum-dum-dumby-doo-wah)

Know this feelin' ain't right (dum-dum-dum-dumby-doo-wah)

There goes my baby
There goes my heart
They're gone forever
So far apart
But only the lonely
Know why
I cry
Only the lonely

Only the lonely
Know the heartaches I've been through
Only the lonely
Know I cried and cried for you

Maybe tomorrow
A new romance
No more sorrow
But that's the chance
You gotta take
Is your lonely heart breaks
Only the lonely

Dum-dum-dum-dumby-doo-wah
