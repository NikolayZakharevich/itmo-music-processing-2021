This is a road,
That I have never, never rode!
Uh, my darling!
Don't wait for me at our home!
And this is something...
That's what I need to remove!
Aah! hey! The shadow!
And even better.
It's even better that you're wrong.
You'll cry, but love is...
The love is dying.
It used to be a lie,
To be a lie.
Don't come back to me
Yea.

I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.
I don't know the way to you
I don't know the way to you
I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.
But I'm still loving you
And I'm still loving you
I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.
I don't know the way to you
I don't know the way to you
I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.

But I'm still loving you
And I'm still loving you
Baby please don't hurt me!
I'll make you cry, but let you go!
Uh, my darling!
I know that you're waiting so long!
And this is something...
That's what I need to remove!
Aah! hey! The shadow!
It's even better.
It's even better that you're wrong.
You'll cry, but love is...
The love is dying.
It used to be a lie,
To be a lie.
Don't come back to me
Yea.

I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.
I don't know the way to you
I don't know the way to you
I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.
But I'm still loving you
And I'm still loving you
I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.
I don't know the way to you
I don't know the way to you
I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.
But I'm still loving you
And I'm still loving you
I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.
I don't know the way to you
I don't know the way to you
I don't need the love and you.
I don't need the love and you.
But I'm still loving you
And I'm still loving you
