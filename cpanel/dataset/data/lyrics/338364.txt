Fade away my time in slow motion
Any day, when I hear you call, I tremble deep inside
Means love tonight…
Jesus handed down his love and cried precious diamonds
You said you’d love me, I saw your eyes shine like diamonds
And my tears are nothing more than a dream
Just like diamonds
Heard a song, my face on your shoulder
For so long I could hear this song
It lingers in my heart
Means love tonight…
Jesus handed down his love and cried precious diamonds
You said you’d love me, I saw your eyes shine like diamonds
And my tears are nothing more than a dream
Just like diamonds
My heart feels Love tonight…
Jesus handed down his love and cried precious diamonds
You said you’d love me, I saw your eyes shine like diamonds…
Jesus handed down his love and cried precious diamonds
You said you’d love me, I saw your eyes shine like diamonds…
(Your eyes keep shining just like diamonds)
Jesus handed down his love and cried precious diamonds
(Your eyes keep shining just like diamonds)
You said you’d love me, I saw your eyes shine like diamonds…
(Your eyes keep shining just like diamonds…
Your eyes keep shining just like diamonds — diamonds…
Your eyes keep shining just like diamonds — diamonds…
Etc.)
