A simple fear to wash you away
An open mind canceled it today
A silent song that’s in your words
A different taste that’s in your mind
This is the life on mars
Mary was a different girl
Had a thing for astronauts
Mary was the type of girl
She always liked to fall apart
Mary was a holy girl
Finally wet her appetite
Mary was the type of girl
She always liked to fall apart
Tell me did you see her face
Tell me did you smell her taste
Tell me what’s the difference
Don’t they all just look the same inside?
See her face, smell her taste
What’s the difference?
Don’t they all just look the same inside?
Mary was an acrobat
But still she couldn’t seem to breathe
Mary was becoming everything she didn’t want to be Mary would hallucinate
And see the sky upon the wall
Mary was the type of girl
She always liked to fly
Tell me did you see her face
Tell me did you smell her taste
Tell me what’s the difference
Don’t they all just look the same inside?
See her face, smell her taste
What’s the difference?
Don’t they all just look the same inside?
This is the life on mars
He said, Can you here me, are you sleeping
She said, Will you rape me now?
He said, Leave the politics to mad men
She said, I believe your lies
He said, There’s a paradise beneath me She said, Am I supposed to bleed?
He said, You better pray to Jesus
She said, I don’t believe in god
Mary was a different girl
Had a thing for astronauts
Mary was the type of girl
She always liked to play god
Mary was a holy girl
Finally wet her appetite
Mary was the type of girl
She always liked to fall apart
Tell me did you see her face
Tell me did you smell her taste
Tell me what’s the difference
Don’t they all just look the same inside?
See her face, smell her taste
What’s the difference?
Don’t they all just look the same inside?
A simple fear to wash you away
