Deep in Canadian woods we ment from one bright island flown.
Great is the land we tread but yet our hearts are with our own
And there we leave the shanty small while fades the autumn day.
We’ll toast ol' Ireland, dear ol' Ireland, Ireland boys hurray!
Oh Ireland boys hurray! Ireland boys hurray!
We’ll toast ol' Ireland, dear ol' Ireland, Ireland boys hurray!
We’ve heard her faults a hundred times the new ones and the old
In songs and stories, rants and rhymes, and larks some 50 fold.
But take them all the great and small and this is what we’ll say
Here’s good old Ireland, loved old Ireland, Ireland boys hurray!
Oh Ireland boys hurray! Ireland boys hurray!
We’ll toast ol' Ireland, dear ol' Ireland, Ireland boys hurray!
We know both brave and good men trying to snap their rusty chains
While patriots grieve and martyrs die, some still sing in vain.
And always know a glance will show how far they’ve won their way!
Hooray for Ireland! God bless Ireland! Ireland boys hurray!
Oh Ireland boys hurray! Ireland boys hurray!
We’ll toast ol' Ireland, dear ol' Ireland, Ireland boys hurray!
Deep in Canandain woods we met and we never may see again
Wild Ireland where our hearts are set and our loved ones do remain.
So come fill up another cup and with every sup we’ll say,
«Here's too ol' Ireland, long live Ireland, Ireland boys hurray!»
Oh Ireland boys hurray! Ireland boys hurray!
We’ll toast ol' Ireland, dear ol' Ireland, Ireland boys hurray!
Oh Ireland boys hurray! Ireland boys hurray!
We’ll toast ol' Ireland, dear ol' Ireland, Ireland boys hurray!
