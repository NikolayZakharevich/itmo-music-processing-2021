What have I become
I’m yours alone
You do not care but I want more
What else is right, and so pure
I’ll save a lifetime of love for you
But you don’t care
Isn’t it something in your eyes
Isn’t it something in the smile
Isn’t it something that can change my point of view
Could it be the lost that i have found
Could it be the way that I’m nailed straight to the ground
Could it be that your the one for me
Help me please
With just one glance, I’m under your spell
You read my soul, I breathe you in as i lie still
And now i come to realize that I’m not happy without your eyes
I cheated myself and let you in, just like Finn
Let Stella in, it broke two hearts
Could it be something in your eyes
Could it be something in your smile
Could it be something that can change my point of view
Could it be the lost that I have found
Could it be the way that I’m nailed straight to the ground
Could it be that your the one for me
Help me please
Tell me what’s that on your eyes
I will let you be loved
Tell me what’s that on your eyes oh
Oh
And oh, my God
I don’t ask for much
Except for the one that I can’t touch
What have I done
