I don't do this for the riches
I'm infected, my condition
Is I'm always in my head
These words are my religion
I'm obsessive by decision
I'mma do this 'til I'm dead

Set me on fire
Set me on, set me on fire (Whoa) (Whoa-oh)
I'm still alive
I'm still a, I'm still alive (Whoa)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Fire, faster, everlasting
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Higher, faster, never-crashing
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Stronger
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

I do this with conviction
I write truths and never fiction
My disease is what you fed
I can't stop with my ambition
Like a missile on a mission
I'm a force that you will dread

Set me on fire
Set me on, set me on fire (Whoa) (Whoa-oh)
I'm still alive
I'm still a, I'm still alive (Whoa)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Stronger
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm not dead
I'm not dead
Bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm not dead
I'm not dead
Stronger, stronger, everlasting
Now you're faster, never-crashing
Stronger, stronger, everlasting
Now you're faster, never-crashing
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Stronger
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Stronger
(Bet you thought that I was dead, but I'm not dead, I'm not dead)
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger
(Bet you thought that I was dead, but I'm not dead, I'm not dead)
(Stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
