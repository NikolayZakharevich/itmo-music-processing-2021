Tonight we escape
just you and me
we'll find our peace
somewhere across the seas?

enough of the fright
enough of the fuss
I'll be awake if he finds us
needless to say
I'll stand in your way
I will protect you
and I...

I'll take the shot for you
I'll be the shield for you
needless to say
I'll stand in your way
I'll take the shot for you
I'll give my life for you
I'll make it stop
I'll take the shot for you
for you

tonight we'll be free
I'll find us a home?
tonight we will be
finally on our own

enough of the hell
enough of the pain
I won't let him touch you
I love you
needless to say
I'll stand in your way
I will defend you
and I'll....

I'll take the...

enough of the scars
enough broken hearts
I will protect you
and I..

I'll take the shot
I'll make it stop

I'll make it stop
I'll take the shot
