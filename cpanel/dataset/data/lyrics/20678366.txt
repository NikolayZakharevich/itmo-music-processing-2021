It’s a great day, I’m feelin’ good
The possibilites of what I could
Do with the world at my finger tips
My imagination brings a smile up to my lips

Fascinated I am movin fast
I’m optimistic as the days go past
Opportunity is here for me
So come along and take a look because I want you to see yeahhh

The world is yours, look a little bit closer
If you want it, come and get it, you can take it over
You can make your tomorrows, what you want them to be
You got the power in your hands, to shape your history

You gotta take it up a level, and go up higher
Put more fuel in the tank, and turn up the fire
Come on, and take leap into your destiny
And come on up, come up, come up with me

We’re going up, up up, and up, up, up

We’re going up, to the top, won’t stop, now I’m feelin it
Celebrate life, good times all around
I wanna keep it, keep it simple, so its not complicated
And that what goes up, doesn’t have to come down

It’s looking like another sunny, Sunday
Good days are here, no I’m not waiting on one day
Get up, get movin, and come on and see
Because it’s time to live life, a life that’s happy and free

The world is yours, look a little bit closer
If you want it, come and get it, you can take it over
You can make your tomorrows, what you want them to be
You got the power in your hands, to shape your history

You gotta take it up a level, and go up higher
Put more fuel in the tank, and turn up the fire
Come on, and take leap into your destiny
And come on up, come up, come up with me

We’re going up, up up, and up, up, up
