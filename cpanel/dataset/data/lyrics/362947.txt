Do you still remember, how we used to be
Feeling together, believe in whatever
My lover said to me,
Both of us were dreamers,
Young love in the sun
Felt like my Saviour, my spirit I gave you
We'd only just begun

Hasta mañana, always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live Forever for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes I still remember, every whispered word
The touch of your skin
Giving life from within like a love song never heard

Slipping through our fingers, like the sands of time
Promises made
Every memory saved has reflections in my mind

Hasta mañana, always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting like the sun
Live Forever for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Back where I belong now,
Was it just a dream
Feelings unfold
They will never be sold and your secrets safe with me

Hasta mañana, always be mine (be mine)

Viva forever, I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting like the sun
Live Forever (live forever) for the moment
Ever searching for the one (for the one)...
