Killer for hire, soldier of fortune
Gotta walk through fire for what's important
And the warrior's blood through your veins is coursing
Killer for hire, soldier of fortune

The whole world's watching every move
Take your shot, don't act a fool
All you've got and all you'll ever need

Is one bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy, take your aim boy
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do?
All eyes on you

One bullet in the chamber
Release it, take your aim, boy
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do?
All eyes on you

Do or die, you're a mercenary
One of a kind, that's your burden to carry
Go and make them proud, do what's necessary
Oh no, do or die, you're a mercenary

Now the whole world's watching every move
Take your shot, don't act a fool
All you've got and all you'll ever need

Is one bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy, take your aim boy
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do?
All eyes on you

One bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy, take your aim boy
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do?
All eyes on you

Now the whole world's watching every move
Still your heart so much to prove
Fight for all the things that you believe in

Now the whole world's watching every move
Take your shot, don't act a fool
All you've got and all you'll ever need

Is one bullet in the chamber

Is one bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy, take your aim boy
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do?
All eyes on you

One bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy, take your aim boy
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do?
All eyes on you
