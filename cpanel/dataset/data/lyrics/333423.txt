Nothing’s ever good enough for you
I was there
And it wasn’t like that
You came here
Just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punchup at a wedding
Hypocrite opportunist
Don’t infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn around
You Stay
Frozen to the spot
The pointless snide remarks
The pot will call the kettle black
It’s a drunken punchup at a wedding
