Standing here in the rain
I can see the water soaking through
The holes in your shoes
And turn your mind from the storm
Get you somewhere safe
Where it’s soft and warm
I’m waiting here at a dim street light
Orange dances around in your empty eyes
And I can see straight into your soul
Feeling oh so lost and out of control
Oh
Shine
If your heart tells you to
Then who are you to question it
Shine
If the world gets you down
Don’t be afraid to wrestle it
Shine
You have your whole life ahead of you
Come, make a mess of it
Shine
If your heart tells you to
Then who are you to question it
Who are you to question it
Tired now, feeling scared
Unfamiliar light floods into the room
You have walked into
Hopeful eyes looking out
As you wait alone
Hiding tears of doubt
Now holding back as you realize your abandonment
You’ll be cast aside
And I can see straight into your soul
Feeling oh so lost and out of control
Shine
If your heart tells you to
Then who are you to question it
Shine
If the world gets you down
Don’t be afraid to wrestle it
Shine
You have your whole life ahead of you
Come, make a mess of it
Shine
If your heart tells you to
Then who are you to question it
Who are you to question it
Hold my hand when the lights go down
And you’re feeling scared, but no one understands
Keep your head up and don’t look down
I’ll guard your stance to keep you on the ground
Your love is strong
And they just don’t deserve
To choose where you belong
Shine
If your heart tells you to
Then who are you to question it
Shine
If the world gets you down
Don’t be afraid to wrestle it
Shine
You have your whole life ahead of you
Come, make a mess of it
Shine
If your heart tells you to
Then who are you to question it
Who are you to question it
