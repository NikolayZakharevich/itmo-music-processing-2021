Aye, Jill, you know the old sugar daddies?
They be tricking, they tell them girls
I said you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
Baby, you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you can go wherever you like
I said you can go wherever you like
Anytime you want to pick up the telephone, you
Know it ain’t nothing to drop a couple stacks on you
Want it, you can get it, my dear
Five million dollar home, drop Bentleys, I swear
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won’t need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I’ll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you can go wherever you like
I said you can go wherever you like
Shawty, you the hottest, love the way you drop it
Brain so good could’ve sworn you went to college.
Hundred K deposit, vacations in the tropics
Everybody know it ain’t tricking if you got it
And you ain’t never ever gotta go in your wallet.
Long as I got rubber-band banks in my pocket
Five, six rides with rims and a body kit
You ain’t gotta downgrade, you can get what I get
My chick can have what she want
And go in any store buy any bag she want
I know you ain’t ever had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desire like that
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won’t need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I’ll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you can go wherever you like
I said you can go wherever you like
I’m talking big boy rides, and big boy ice
Let me put this big boy in your life
That thing get so wet and hit so right
Let me put this big boy in your life; that’s right
I want your body, need your body
Long as you got me you won’t need nobody
You want it, I got it, go get it, I’ll buy it
Tell them other broke nigga be quiet
Stacks on deck, Patron on ice
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you can have whatever you like
I said you can have whatever you like
Late night sex, so wet and so tight
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you can go wherever you like
I said you can go wherever you like
Hey, Jill
