Bye and bye, I’m going to see the King
Bye and bye, I’m going to see the King
Well I don’t mind dying, if dying was all
See the wheel, the wheel in the middle of the wheel
Free the wheel, the wheel in the middle of the wheel
Well I don’t mind dying, if dying was all
Jack went up to fetch a pail of water
Jill came down and put it on the fire
Jack said, Jill I believe we’re going to have some fun
The signs they say the world began with a Big Bang
Bye and bye, I’m going to see the King
Bye and bye, I’m going to see the King
Well I don’t mind dying, if dying was all
I said, I don’t mind dying, I don’t mind dying anymore
See the wheel, the wheel in the middle of the wheel
Free the wheel, the wheel in the middle of the wheel
Well I don’t mind dying, if dying was all
I said, I don’t mind dying, no I don’t mind dying at all
Jack went up to fetch a pail of water
Jill came down and put it on the fire
Jack said Jill I believe we’re gonna have a son
The signs they say the world will end with a Big Bang
