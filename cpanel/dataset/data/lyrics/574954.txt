Hear it through the ceilings*
And through the night
Those sweet sounds of silence
Till morning light
Hear it through the windows
And through the walls
Forever changing it all

Our love (love), our love (love)
Love, the sound of love
Love, the sound of love
Playing in my mind
Playing when I find you

Can't get too close to you
Ain't gonna try
You're not the one for me
Don't wanna lie
No, No, that's a no-no
I'd better go
Unless we can play it
Your stereo

Our love (love), our love (love)
Love, the sound of love
Love, the sound of love
Playing in my mind
Playing when i find you

Our love (love), our love (love)
love, the sound of love
love, the sound of love
playing in my mind
playing when i find you

Our love (love), our love (love)
love, the sound of love
love, the sound of love
playing in my mind
playing when i find you
