I try to find you in all the fairytales that I read
I want that perfect kiss from that famous movie scene
If I could break the walls between my reality and my dream
Every day I would wake up to see you smiling back at me

(Ooh) Had my palm read a million times before
Ask myself when you'll come and knock on my door
Ain't no crystal ball to show me where you are
Wonder where is that love that starts with hello

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Where is that love that starts with hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Wish love could be just that simple

What's the point building a kingdom if there is no queen?
I'm screaming from the top of my lungs right now
Can you hear me calling?
One day my mama told me you'd come and I've been waiting
For the day when I'll wake up and see you smiling back at me

Had my palm read a million times before
Wonder where is that love that starts with hello

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Where is that love that starts with hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Wish love could be just that simple

I know I'll love every inch of your body, baby
Already see our future in your eyes, baby
Oh, I miss you

Had my palm read a million times before
Wonder where is that love that starts with hello

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Where is that love that starts with hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Where is that love that starts with hello
