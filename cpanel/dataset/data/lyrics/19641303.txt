As a child, you would wait 
And watch from far away
But you always knew that you'll be the one 
That work while they all play 
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme 
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream 

Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town 
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town 
From dust

The time will come, when you'll have to rise 
Above the best, improve yourself 
Your spirit never dies 
Farewell, I've gone, to take my throne 
Above, don't weep for me 
Cuz this will be the labor of my love 

Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town 
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town 
From dust

Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town 
From dust
