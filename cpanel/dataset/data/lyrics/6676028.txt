I saw you again
It felt like we had never met
It’s like the sun set in your eyes
And never wanted to rise
And what have you done
With the one I love?
When I look into your eyes
I see no surprise

I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we have
We act like we have never met

We make believe
I’ve never seen your face you neither mine
And catch my eye don’t register a smile
You were more than just a friend
Ooh, but the feeling
It never came to an end
I can’t bear to see you

I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
Now it feels like you see through me

When I see you again
I’ll know not to expect
Stay one step away
We won’t have to wait

When I see you again
And I’m greeted as a friend
It is understood
That we did all we could

I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
Alter all that we had
We act like we have never met

I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
Now it feels like you see through me
