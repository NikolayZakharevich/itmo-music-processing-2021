Will you come with me a-roving through the hills of Donegal?
I’ll ask you once again to follow me
No matter where we roam
Or whatever might befall
With you beside me life is fancy free
So come away with me
And I will make you see
We’re meant to be together for all time
Given half a chance
Sure I think we’d find romance
For you’re the one that’s always on me mind
There was a time I was content to ramble on me own
But since I fell for you I lost me way
You got me heart a thumpin'
More than anyone I’ve known
Don’t know if it’s tomorrow or today
So come away with me
And I will make you see
We’re meant to be together for all time
Given half a chance
Sure I think we’d find romance
For you’re the one that’s always on me mind
I’ll show you, , and
Mount Errigal we’ll pass along the way
We’ll wander down the coast road
And by the shore
And watch the sunset on Gweebarra Bay
So come away with me
And I will make you see
We’re meant to be together for all time
Given half a chance
Sure I think we’d find romance
For you’re the one that’s always on me mind
Me heart is glad today like it never was before
Since she said «I'll come away with you»
I haven’t much to give her
But I’ve got love galore
Through fair or stormy weather I’ll be true
So come away with me
And I will make you see
We’re meant to be together for all time
Given half a chance
Sure I think we’d find romance
For you’re the one that’s always on me mind
So come away with me
And I will make you see
We’re meant to be together for all time
Given half a chance
Sure I think we’d find romance
For you’re the one that’s always on me mind
