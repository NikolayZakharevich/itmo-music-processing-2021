You lost your self respect
You gave it all away
For no good reason
What were you thinking
Flirt with me If you want me to
I’ll do it for you
When you got that
Smile on your face
That look in yourt eye
So look into these eyes
And tell me what you see
Do you see affection
The way it should be Come on Flirt with me If you want me to
I’ll do it for you
When you got that
Smile on your face
That look in your eye
You want everything
I am the first you will ever have
I am your lover
I’m your God
When I get close to you
When you got that
Smile on your face
That look in your eye
You want everything
