Don't ever think you're the first one who did it
Dos Bros, Dos Bros did it
And you wouldn't believe who already knew
Dos Bros, Dos Bros knew it
They came, they saw, they took, they shook
No one can stop them go, go!
Don't ever think so

From the outside
They're handsome devils
From the inside
They're true born rebels

Woooh, Woooooh
Cut across! ¡Venga! Let's go! Dos Bros!
Woooh, Woooooh
Let the freak flag fly, Dos Bros, ¡vamonos!
Hey give up do commo do loquo
Viva Dos Bros, I need your vachaleo
Ey, Ey, vato — wild and furious
Dos Bros, Dos Bros vamonos

Oho Oho Oho

Don't ever make Dos Bros your enemy (oho)
They're unbeatable, they're uncheatable
And if help breaks loose you will understand
It's here to have friends in a rock band
They rule, you drool, they rock until you drop
No one can stop them, blow blow
Don't ever think so

From the outside
They're pure gold getters
From the inside
They're real jet-setters

Woooh, Woooooh
Cut across! ¡Venga! Let's go! Dos Bros!
Woooh, Woooooh
Let the freak flag fly, Dos Bros, ¡vamonos!
Hey give up do commo do loquo
Viva Dos Bros, I need your vachaleo
Ey, Ey, vato — wild and furious
Dos Bros, Dos Bros vamonos

Let me ask you this — Shut up. (Oho)
I got a question — be crazy. (Oho)
You better never ever mess — with Dos Bros (Oho)
Because you're messing with the los Dos Bros
Don't ever think you're the first one who did it
Dos Bros, Dos Bros did it
And you wouldn't believe who already knew
Dos Bros, Dos Bros knew it

They came, they saw, they took, they shook
No one can stop them go, go!
Don't ever think so

Woooh, Woooooh
Cut across! ¡Venga! Let's go! Dos Bros!
Woooh, Woooooh
Let the freak flag fly, Dos Bros, ¡vamonos!
Hey give up do commo do loquo
Viva Dos Bros, I need your vachaleo
Ey, Ey, vato — wild and furious
Dos Bros, Dos Bros vamonos
