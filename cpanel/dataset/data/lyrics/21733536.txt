I wish that boats were little glasses filled with wine
So I could drink to love with all your friends and mine
Some day we’ll pull your boat ashore
The day you sail away no more
My friend the sea says you’ll be mine
The day I fill your boat with wine
And so I dream of what w’ll be And I believe my friend the sea
I wish the mountain was smaller than a star
So I could see your boat and know just where you are
I wish my arms were nuts of gold
For you are all I want to hold
My friend the sea says you’ll be mine
The day I fill your boat with wine
And so I dream of what w’ll be And I believe my friend the sea
Some day I’ll fill your boat with wine
My friend the sea will know you’re mine
