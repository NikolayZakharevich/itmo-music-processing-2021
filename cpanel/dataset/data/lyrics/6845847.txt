Michael Rennie was ill the day the earth stood still
But he told us where we stand

Science Fiction — Double Feature
Dr. X will build a creature
See androids fighting Brad and Janet
Anne Francis stars in Forbidden Planet

By RKO, oh-oh, at the late night double feature picture show.
In the back row at the late night double feature picture show.
