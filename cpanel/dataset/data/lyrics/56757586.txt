I been out here for a minute
Hands clenched as I walk through the fog
Blood in the water
Smoke in the air filling my lungs
You were a friend
Veil torn now I'm seeing your lies
Full of demise
Blood moon painting red in the sky
Under the surface
Your dark heart leading you to the grave
Beautiful mask
Pure evil behind the charade
I hear the mourning
I hear the cries
Out of darkness into the light
If you want me gone
You pull the trigger yourself
Look me in the eyes

I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy
I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy

You want me dead
You want me gone
Covered in evil you turned on us all
Hungry for power
Hungry for fame
You'll kill a man if he gets in your way
I walk through the valley of shadows
I'm not alone, no I won't fear
The Hangman's at the gallows
I'm not afraid of the death in his stare
I'll never be like you
I'll never be like you
I'm rising up and I'm ready to fight you
Ready to fight you
I'm all in
I've seen you before
You all are the same
You're just another goin' up in the flames
And if I'm gon' die in the fight
It'll be while I am bringing you down to the grave

I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy
I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy
I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy
I see who you are, you are my enemy
My enemy, you are my enemy

This ends now
Whoa, whoa, whoa
This ends now
Whoa, whoa, whoa
This ends now
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm ready to fight you, ready to fight you
This ends now
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm ready to fight you, ready to fight you
This ends now
(This ends now)
