Wish you were here…
Me, oh, my country man,
Wish you were here…
I wish you were here…
Don’t you know, the snow is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell,
And I’m feeling blue…

Wish you were here…
Me, oh, my country man,
Wish you were here…
I wish you were here…
Don’t you know, the snow is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell,
And I’m feeling blue…

I’ve got feelings for you,
Do you still feel the same?
From the first time I laid my eyes on you,
I felt joy of living,
I saw heaven in your eyes…
In your eyes…

Wish you were here…
Me, oh, my country man,
Wish you were here…
I wish you were here…
Don’t you know the snow is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell…
And I’m feeling blue…

I miss your laugh, i miss your smile,
I miss everything about you…
Every second’s like a minute,
Every minute’s like a day
When you’re far away…

The snow is getting colder, baby,
And I wish you were here…
A battlefield of love and fear,
And I wish you were here…

I’ve got feelings for you,
From the first time I laid my eyes on you…

Wish you were here…
Me, oh, my country man,
Wish you were here…
I wish you were here…
Don’t you know the snow is getting colder,
And I miss you like hell…
And I’m feeling blue…

Wish you were here…
Wish you were here…
Wish you were here…
Wish you were here…
I wish you were here…
