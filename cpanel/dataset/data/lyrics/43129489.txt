She was so sublime, super fine
She was never lying
Strutting in her heels, or her slides, either way
Eyes on her every single day, week, year
Everyone wondering how she does it with no fear
All that confidence was it heaven-sent?
Does it come within?
Does it come run out? I don't know
She'll just have 'em runnin' out and in
Man they want to sin, talking deadly sin
With Mrs. lady, I don't understand
Why she hit 'em like (Tadow, tadow)
