You don't mean to be a problem
You don't mean to cause me pain
You don't mean to do much but they're one and the same
I don't know where this came from
I thought we were plain sailing
This has taken me aback and it, it goes without saying
That I'm gonna feel broken for a bit
Life's gonna be a little bit shit
Oh, for at least the next week
We had our flaws I'll be the first to admit
And we both struggled to commit
Oh, was it really that bleak?

And I don't know why I've been crying over you
For the life of me, I wish that I knew
And I don't know, just how much more I can go through
Man, oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you

I don't mean to be a problem
I don't mean to cause you pain
Don't wanna break it up but, there's no other way
You're not the only one who's hurting
Or who's finding this hard
But you gotta admit that we're drifting apart
Look, we're gonna feel broken for a bit
And it's gonna be a little bit shit
But you'll find the strength when you're weak
You'll find a love when you least expect it
It could be any minute
So don't fight the tears on your cheek

And I don't know why I've been crying over you
For the life of me, I wish that I knew
And I don't know, just how much more I can go through
Man oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you

Now I don't like a clich√©
But I'm reading from the same book all over again
All different covers, all different colors
They're never the same
But they always make me cry in the end
We thought we gave each other a whole world
But it turns out we that didn't know such a thing
Guess life's like this, shit happens
And we look for the magic
But good things always come to an end, an end
Ya know?

And I don't know (I don't know) why I've been crying over you (Over you)
For the life of me, I wish that I knew
And I don't know (Oh, I don't know), just how much more I can go through
Man, oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you

Man, oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you
Man, oh man I wish I knew, why I've been crying over you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
