This was leading nowhere
My plans had failed
The light was shining on someone else
I found myself in complete darkness
I’m the only one responsible, so I’m the only one to blame
And I’ll ask Father for forgiveness
It’s a boomerang
It’s a boomerang
This was leading nowhere
I was looking but couldn’t find work
I wanted it to happen without jeopardising you
I’m the only one responsible, so I’m the only one to blame
And I’ll ask Father for forgiveness
It’s a boomerang
It’s a boomerang
In the name of the Most Powerful, I do regret this
So the message is: if you don’t know where
You’re heading anymore
Go back to where you come from

Where everybody knows your name
The place where you grew up
Where you took your first steps
And received your education
It’s a boomerang
It’s a boomerang
It’s a boomerang
