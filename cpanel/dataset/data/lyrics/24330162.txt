Standing here in the music hall
With my microphone and a glitterball
And you walked right in, blowing through the doors
Like a force of nature, a force of nature
I cannot go, 'cause my head's a mess
But you're beautiful
In the way you dress
I'm lost for words
And I'm powerless
Right from the beginning
You got me singing

Ooh singing
Ooh singing
Ooh singing
Oh, I'm so in love with you
Ooh singing
Ooh singing
Ooh singing
Oh, I'm so in love with you

I thought I lost you in the crowd
But I came out where you stand up
You're like the storm through the evening rage
And bells are ringing, you got me singing
Ooh singing
Ooh singing
Ooh singing
Oh, I'm so in love with you
Ooh singing
Ooh singing
Ooh singing
Oh, I'm so in love with you
