Underneath the echoes
Buried in the shadows
There you were.
Drawn into your mystery
I was just beginning
To see your ghost,
But you must know
I’ll be here waiting
Hoping
Praying
That this light will guide you home.
When you’re feeling lost
Don’t leave, my love
Hidden in the sun,
For when the darkness comes.
Now the door is open,
The world I knew is broken.
With no return.
Now my heart is not scared,
Just knowing that you’re out there.
Watching me.
So believe
I’ll be here waiting
Hoping
Praying
That this light will guide you home.
When you’re feeling lost
Don’t leave, my love
Hidden in the sun,
For when the darkness comes.
For when the darkness comes.
Be here waiting
Hoping
Praying that, this light will guide you home.
When you’re feeling lost don’t leave, my love.
Hidden in the sun, for when the darkness comes.
Hidden in the sun, for when the darkness comes.
