When you look at my life, tell me what do you see?
I’m only human, so don’t expect too much from me
I lost my faith, what have I become?
I don’t think I can be safe from what I’m running for
Will you remember me
If I were to fall into the sky?
And what will they think of me
If I leave it all behind?
When I leave it all behind?
Would you be so surprised if I gave up tonight?
I’m barely breathing, I wanna kill the pain I feel inside
But I won’t quit for the people I love
So I’ll say I’m fine until the day I fucking see the light
Will you remember me
If I were to fall into the sky?
And what will they think of me
If I leave it all behind?
When I leave it all behind?
If you feel like you are nothing
If you feel like letting go
I’ll be your hope when you are hopeless
Together, we are not alone
You’re not alone
Will you remember me (Remember me)
If I were to fall into the sky? (Fall into the sky)
And what will they think of me (Think of me)
If I leave it all behind?
When I leave it all behind?
Yeah
