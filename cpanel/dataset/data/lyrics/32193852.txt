Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
I feel like the sun might give way
Gentle implosions
Wakes and makes me tired
Fearless on my breath
 
Teardrops on your fire
Burning in my heart today
Teardrops on your fire
Burning away
 
Teardrops in your fire
Black flowers blossom
I feel like the sun might give way
Oceans in my head
Crash against my lonely bed
I feel like the sun might give way
 
Teardrops on your fire
Burning in my heart today
Teardrops on your fire
Burning away
 
Teardrops on your fire
I feel them burning
Burning
 
Teardrops on your fire
Burning on your fire
Oh teardrops on your fire
Burning on your fire
