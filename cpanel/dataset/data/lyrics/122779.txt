Here we are at last
The moment soon will pass
Well go our seperate ways
Well vanish in the haze
Well never be the same
Well forget each others names
Well grow old and lose our hair
Its all downhill from there
But tonight well reach for the stars
Well rent expensive cars
And dream our dreams
Of a perfect night
And well sing our prom theme
Here we are at last
Were running out of gas
The air is getting thick
The girls are feeling sick
Well pass out on the beach
Our keys just out of reach
And soon well say goodbye
Then well work until we die
But tonight we feel like stars
Well play our air guitars
Cause were eighteen
Its a perfect night
To sing our prom theme
