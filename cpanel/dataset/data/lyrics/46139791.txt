Can we just lay here?
Beautiful morning
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love
Tell me you’re all in when the rain’s pouring
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love
Was I cold to the touch?
I can almost still feel it, I know
The sweetest wine against my lips, how it lingers
But you know I can’t sleep with my head like that
I just stay laying here
The things that I would dream with my head like that
I watch the day appear instead
Can we just lay here?
Beautiful morning
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love
Tell me you’re all in when the rain’s pouring
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love
I’ll be kissing rhythms from your neck
Chasing melodies around your skin
And all the songs my lips should wed
Replay over and over again
You were caught in my mind
I can almost still feel it, I know
You’re sweet like wine against my lips
How it lingers
But you know I can’t sleep with my head like that
I’ll just stay lying here
The things that I would dream with my head like that
I’ll watch the day appear instead
Can we just lay here?
Beautiful morning
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love
Tell me you’re all in when the rain’s pouring
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love
Tell me all of your worries
Give me all of your love
Tell me, tell me all your worries
Give me all of your love
