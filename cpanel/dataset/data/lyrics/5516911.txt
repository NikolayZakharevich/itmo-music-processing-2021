I was all right, for a while
I could smile for a while
But I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
As you stopped to say 'Hello'
Oh You wished me well You couldn't tell

That I've been crying over you
Crying over you And you said "So long"
Left me standing all alone Alone and crying
crying, crying, crying It's hard to understand
But the touch of your hand
Can start me crying.

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true I love you even more
Than I did before But darling, what can I do?
For you don't love me And I'll always be
Crying over you Crying over you

Yes, now you're gone And from this moment on
I'll be crying crying, crying, crying
Yeah, crying, crying over you
