She was just a young girl
Waiting for the day
Life will make it happen
Take away the pain

He was just a young boy
Hoping for the same
But he didn’t notice
Oh man, what a shame

Am I just wasting
Am I just wasting time?
Or am I just waiting
For you to open your eyes?

3, 2, 1 I’m ready for it, ready for it
3 to 1 you don’t need a gun to shoot me
3, 2, 1 I’m ready for it, ready for it
3 to 1 you don’t need a gun

Everything is different
And we ain’t the same
But you’re begging me
‘Can we play another game?’

Am I just wasting
Am I just wasting time?
Or am I just waiting
For you to open your eyes?

3, 2, 1 I’m ready for it, ready for it
3 to 1 you don’t need a gun to shoot me
3, 2, 1 I’m ready for it, ready for it
3 to 1 you don’t need a gun

Don’t you wanna learn?
If you don’t live in Light, you will not survive
And all the times you feel alone
There is a home for you where you can return

3, 2, 1 I’m ready for it, ready for it
3 to 1 you don’t need a gun to shoot me
3, 2, 1 I’m ready for it, ready for it
3 to 1 you don’t need a gun
