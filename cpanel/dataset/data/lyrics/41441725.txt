Inna the streets busy life is a chapper
While you at you work you affi stay on the upper
Those who disagreed choose the way of a Dapper
Those who blend right in choose the book and the laptop
Who have hears to hear listen to what mama said
Sit down Inna church and be quiet and pray
You taking on the wrong pledge
Your life not granted
So your story echoes in my head

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

This is the story of a man I used to know
He never listen to his dad an mama words
He found shelter inna wrong place
Friends with a screw face
Then Killed by their wrong ways
Justice no kind
It's vision blind
Forward with the sentence
No judge can't rewind
Rest indeed yoooh
Rest in peace bro
Rest in me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven

There's still place that once you called your own
Not a war zone not a funeral home
Silent, no more music, no sound
Under the moonlight inna a Small town
Guiltiness rest on their shoulder
So for the wicked man
His days are numbered
Rest indeed
Rest In peace
Rest in me

What I've felt
What I've known

Never free
Never me

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
