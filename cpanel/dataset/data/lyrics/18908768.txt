Hey
Anybody know the way back
Where I’m from?
Too much freedom has sent me numb
Ooh, try to kid yourself you knew it all along
But the right way becomes the
Wrong one …
But hey, we’re ok my friend
Nobody died in the end
And these stupid things
Don’t matter in the light
So hold tight
Ooh, did you ever think it’s you
They’re looking for
But they don’t knock upon your door?
Day becomes the night
And once again
Light a candle, it never ends
But wait, we’re ok my friend
Nobody died in the end
And these stupid things
Don’t matter in the light
Hey, you’re ok my friend
Nobody dies in the end
And these stupid things
Don’t matter in
'the light'
So hold tight
