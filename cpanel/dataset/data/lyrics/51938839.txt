Rock it

You're my nicotine
I'm your dirty team
You're my girl
You are my reason to believe

You're my ecstasy
I'm your remedy
You're the one I like
My reason to believe

Rock it
Get in the groove
Rock it
Just whip it good
So your body can move
Everybody, let loose

Rock it
Get in the groove
Rock it
Just whip it good
So your body can move
Everybody, let loose

Um, dois, três, quatro

You're my lovely queen
I'm your dirty king
You're my girl
You are my reason to believe

I'm your sweet lucky
You're my guillotine
You're the one I like
My reason to believe

Rock it
Get in the groove
Rock it
Just whip it good
So your body can move
Everybody, let loose

Rock it
Get in the groove
Rock it
Just whip it good
So your body can move
Everybody, let loose

Um, dois, três, quatro

Get in the groove
Just whip it good
So your body can move
Everybody, let loose
Get in the groove
Just whip it good
So your body can move
Everybody, let loose
