Pressure, pressure calls my name
I think it's time that I should
Push it back and entertain it (Entertain it)
I measure, measure in my brain
All of the times that I've been too afraid
It's time to change it (Change it)

Time is the key but the devil just keeps on knockin'
I don't want to stand at the doorway of the forgotten, oh, oh-oh
Fear wears a smile but I'll be the last one laughing
Try to take me down, no, it ain't never gonna happen, oh, oh-oh
No, not today, not gonna make the same mistakes
No, not today, not gonna cave, not gonna break

Under the pressure, under the pressure (Whoa)
I'm never going to break (Whoa), no matter what it takes
Under the pressure, under the pressure (Whoa)
I'm never going to break (Whoa), no matter what it takes

Pressure, pressure calls my name
I think it's time that I should
Push it back and entertain it (Entertain it)
Forever, ever, like a game
Stacked up the cards against me
Now I think my luck is changin' (Changin')

Time is the key but the devil just keeps on knockin'
I don't want to stand at the doorway of the forgotten, oh, oh-oh
Fear wears a smile but I'll be the last one laughing
Try to take me down, no, it ain't never gonna happen, oh, oh-oh

Under the pressure, under the pressure (Whoa)
I'm never gonna break (Whoa), no matter what it takes
Under the pressure, under the pressure (Whoa)
I'm never gonna break (Whoa), no matter what it takes

No, not today, not gonna make the same mistakes
No, not today, not gonna cave, not gonna break
No, not today, not gonna make the same mistakes
No, not today, not gonna cave, not gonna break

Under the pressure, under the pressure (Whoa)
I'm never gonna break (Whoa), no matter what it takes
Under the pressure, under the pressure (Whoa)
I'm never gonna break (Whoa), no matter what it takes

I'm never gonna break, no matter what it takes
I'm never gonna break, no matter what it takes
