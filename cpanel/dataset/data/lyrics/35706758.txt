I’m electric
Chemicals I breathe, (yeah)
And did I mention
I bleed kerosene
When sparks begin to fly
Oh the flames they multiply
Well I’m burnin' up alive
I said I’m burnin' up alive
My Mr. Rager
My Jekyll and Hyde
My only savior
Is when I look into your eyes
They tell no lies
I can feel the conversation
Starting to arise
I’m a living legend
I’m a broken man
Who are you?
So who are you?
Today
Everybody’s got demons
And sometimes they take control
Everybody’s got demons
Sometimes they got to go
Sometimes they got to go
When I’m gone remember me
I’m electric
Chemicals I breathe, (yeah)
And did I mention
I bleed kerosene
When sparks begin to fly
Oh the flames they multiply
Well I’m burnin' up alive
But how do we survive?
Survive
Never lose control
Everybody’s got demons
And sometimes they take control
Everybody’s got demons
Sometimes they got to go
Sometimes they got to go
Sometimes they got to go
