It’s back to the basics without you now
I’m trying not to fall under
You told me I should take a look around
Lost it all and it’s no wonder
How it came to be
I’m stepping out the door of you and me
I’m crossing out the eyes and what they’ve seen
I’m better off, I’m better off, I’m better
It’s time for me to breathe
I’m gasping for the air you stole from me
I’m crossing out the eyes and what they’ve seen
I’m better off, I’m better off, I’m better lost
Lost
I’m better lost
Lost
I’m better lost
Been down on defeat
Rose from beneath
To find my escape
I’ll run from the lies
You tried to hide
I’ll vanish without a trace
It’s time for me to breathe
I’m gasping for the air you stole from me
I’m crossing out the eyes and what they’ve seen
I’m better off, I’m better off, I’m better lost
(Now, oh without you, without you now
Now, oh oh-out you, oh-out you now)
I’m better lost
I’ll never need you
To see through
Yeah, I’m better lost
I’m better lost
I’ll never need you
To see through
Yeah, I’m better lost
I’m better lost
I’m better lost
I’m better lost
I’ll never need you
I’m better lost
