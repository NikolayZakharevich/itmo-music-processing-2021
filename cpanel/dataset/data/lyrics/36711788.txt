I reeled you in
Breath me deep like i was oxygen
You try to hold me down and count to ten
But barely made it up to five

But babe, dont lie
And dont expect me to apologize
I tried to warn you 'bout a thousand times
That you would end up geting burned

I took you high
I never meant to set you world on fire
You couldnt see it through you blind desire
That i was only blowing smoke

I got you dazed
You couldn't see it through my purple haze
But you're hooked on me in so many ways
I've gotten underneath your skin

I took you high
I never meant to set you world on fire
You couldnt see it through you blind desire
That i was only blowing smoke

So one last time
Drag me in and hold me deep inside
And maybe you will finaly realize
That i will only make you choke

I reeled you in
Breath me deep like i was oxygen
You try to hold me down and count to ten
But barely made it up to five

I took you high
I never meant to set you world on fire
You couldnt see it through you blind desire
That i was only blowing smoke

So one last time
Drag me in and hold me deep inside
And maybe you will finaly realize
That i will only make you choke

And now it all goes up in smoke
