Welcome to the wild, no heroes and villains
Welcome to the war we've only begun, so
Pick up your weapon and face it
There's blood on the crown; go and take it
You get one shot to make it out alive, so

Higher and higher you chase it
It's deep in your bones; go and take it
This is your moment, now is your time, so

Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Make 'em remember you;
Rise
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
They will remember you;
Rise

Welcome to the climb up, reach for the summit
Visions pray that one false step lead the end, so

Higher and higher you chase it
It's deep in your blood; go and take it
This is your moment, take to the skies, go

Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Make 'em remember you;
Rise
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
They will remember you;
Rise

So get along, so get along, go
Get along-long get a move on up
So get along, so get along, go
Get along-long get a move on up
And as you fight among the death beneath the dirt
(So get along, so get along, go
Get along-long get a move on up)
Well, do you know yet?
(So get along, so get along, go)
Well, do you want it?
(Get along-long get a move on up)
And when the giants call to ask you what you're worth
(So get along, so get along, go
Get along-long get a move on up)
Do you know if?
(So get along, so get along, go)
Win or die, you'll
(Get along-longâ€”)

Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
Make 'em remember you;
Rise
Push through hell and
Rise, rise
They will remember you;
Rise
Prove yourself and
Rise, rise
(Pick up your weapon and face it)
Rise
(It's deep in your blood, go and take it)
Rise, rise
(Higher and higher you chase it)
Rise
(So get along, so get along, go)
Rise, rise
