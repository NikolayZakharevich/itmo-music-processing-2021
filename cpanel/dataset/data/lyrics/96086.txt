How long before I get in
Before it starts, before I begin
How long before you decide
Before I know what it feels like
Where to? Where do I go?
If you’ve never tried then you’ll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna can stand
With my head stuck under the sand
I start before I can stop
Before I see thing the right way up
All that noise, all that sound
All those places that I have found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you’d understand
Ideas that you’ll never find
Or the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China… all lit up
The sign that I couldn’t read
Or the light that I couldn’t see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me
All that noise, all that sound
All those places that I have found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you’d understand
All those signs I knew what they meant
Something you can’t invent
Some get made, and some get sent Ooh
Words go flying at the speed of sound
To show how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you’d understand
Oh, when you see it then you’ll understand
