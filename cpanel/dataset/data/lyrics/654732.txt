Pissing in a river, watching it rise
Tattooed fingers shy away from me
Voices, voices, mesmerize
Voices, voices, beckoning sea
Come, come, come, come back
Come back, come back, come back, come back
Spoke of a wheel, tip of a spoon
Mouth of a cave, I’m a slave, I’m free
When are you coming? Hope you come soon
Fingers fingers encircling thee
Come, come, come, come back
Come, come, come, come, come, ohh, ohh
My bowels are empty excreting your soul
What more can I give you? Baby, I don’t know
What more can I give you to make this thing grow?
Don’t turn your back now, I’m talking to you
Should I pursue a path so twisted?
Should I crawl defeated and gifted?
Should I go the length of the river
The royal, the throne, the cry me a river
Everything I’ve done I’ve done for you
Whoa, I’d give my life for you
And every move I made I move to you
And I come like a magnet for you now
What about it? You’re going to leave me
What about it? You don’t need me
What about it? I can’t live without you
What about it? I never doubted you
What about it? What about it?
What about it? What about it?
Should I pursue a path so twisted?
Should I crawl defeated and gifted?
Should I go the length of the river?
The royal, the throne, the cry me river
What about it? What about it? What about it?
What about it? What about it? What about it?
What about it?
Oh, I’m pissing in a river
Thank you very much
