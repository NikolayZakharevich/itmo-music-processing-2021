We’ll rant and roar upon the spree
And sing and dance right heartily!
No sorrows, cares, or woes have we
The rambling boys of pleasure.
We’ll rant and roar upon the spree
And sing and dance right heartily!
No sorrows, cares, or woes have we
The rambling boys of pleasure.
He’s a hell of a man for drinking stout
And when the barrel has run out,
«Bring more porter!» They will shout.
The rambling boys of pleasure.
We’ll rant and roar upon the spree
And sing and dance right heartily!
No sorrows, cares, or woes have we
The rambling boys of pleasure.
There’s some content that toil away
That have no time for sport or play
The one’s lying us live for today.
We’re the rambling boys of pleasure.
We’ll rant and roar upon the spree
And sing and dance right heartily!
No sorrows, cares, or woes have we
The rambling boys of pleasure.
Now we got sweethearts by the score
All up and down the shamrock shore.
All the lassies do adore
The rambling boys of pleasure.
We’ll rant and roar upon the spree
And sing and dance right heartily!
No sorrows, cares, or woes have we
The rambling boys of pleasure.
Break
We’ll rant and roar upon the spree
And sing and dance right heartily!
No sorrows, cares, or woes have we
The rambling boys of pleasure.
We’ve been from Corrick to Doengal
From Westport to old Cushendall
Where’er we go we’re known to all
As the rambling boys of pleasure
We’ll rant and roar upon the spree
And sing and dance right heartily!
No sorrows, cares, or woes have we
The rambling boys of pleasure.
So if you see us passing by,
Come in and drink if you are dry!
Raise the friendly glass on high
to the rambling boys of pleasure!
We’ll rant and roar upon the spree
And sing and dance right heartily!
No sorrows, cares, or woes have we
The rambling boys of pleasure.
We’ll rant and roar upon the spree
And sing and dance right heartily!
No sorrows, cares, or woes have we
The rambling boys of pleasure.
