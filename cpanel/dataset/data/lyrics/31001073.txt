You think you won
You think I´m done
You shot my brain
But I don't feel the pain
Kings never die
This ain't no lie
You think we're the same
But you never play the game

You killed me on the moon
I was in love with you woman
Your woman down in heaven
There's nothing else to loose
You killed me in the gloom
‘Cause I was holding the whispers
Of your woman that you shot down
So she could never choose

She's my cold Queen
She's my morphine
But you let her in a cage
And things are gonna change now
You're no Hero, no no
You're no outlaw
You think we're the same
But you never play the game

You killed me on the moon
I was in love with you woman
Your woman down in heaven
There's nothing else to loose
You killed me in the gloom
‘Cause I was holding the whispers
Of your woman that you shot down
So she could never choose

So she could never choose
