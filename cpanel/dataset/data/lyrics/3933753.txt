I'm at a payphone trying to call home
all of my change I've spent on you
where have the times gone baby
it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

Yeah I I know it's hard to remember
the people we used to be
it's even harder to picture
that you're not here next to me
you said it's too late to make it
but is it too late to try?
and then that time that you wasted
all of our bridges burnt down

I've wasted my nights
you turned out the lights
now I'm paralyzed
still tuck in that time when we called it love
but even the sun sets the paradise

I'm at a payphone trying to call home
all of my change I've spent on you
where have the times gone baby
it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
all those fairytales are full of shit
one more fuckin' love song I'll be sick

You turned your back on tomorrow
cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
but you just gave it away

you can't expect me to be a friend
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
but all of our bridges burnt down

Man f*ck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
while you sitting round
wondering why it wasn't you
who came up from nothing
made it from the bottom
now when you see me I'm stuntin
and all of my cars are with a push of a button
telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
switched the number to my phone
so you never can call it
don't need my name, or my show
you can tell it I'm ballin'
swish
what a shame coulda got picked
had a really good game but you missed your last shot
so you talk about who you see at the top
or what you could've saw
but sad to say it's over for
phantom roll up valet open doors
where's the car way, got what you was looking for
now it's me who they want
so you can go take that
little piece of shit with you

Now I'm at a payphone
