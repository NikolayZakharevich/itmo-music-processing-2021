Been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Been wasting most their time
Glorifying days long gone behind
Been wasting most their days
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise
Tell me who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?
Dissipation, race relations
Consolation, segregation
Dispensation, isolation
Exploitation, mutilation
Mutations, miscreation
Confirmation to the evils of the world
Been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
Been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They’ve been looking in their minds
For the day that sorrow’s lost from time
They keep telling of the day
When the Savior of love will come to stay
Tell me who of them will come to be?
How many of them are you and me?
Proclamation of race relations
Consolation, integration
Verification of revelations
Acclamation, world salvation
Vibrations, simulation
Confirmation to peace of the world
Been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They’ve been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They’ve been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
We’ve been spending too much of our lives
Living in a pastime paradise
Let’s start living our lives
Living for the future paradise
Praise to our lives
Living for future paradise
Shame to anyones life
Living in a pastime paradise
