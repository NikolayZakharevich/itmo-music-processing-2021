Time Will go and time will find
Secrets underneath one skin
You can still what you can find
Pieces that will feed your greed
Ways to run and holes to skip darling
Than the dragon split the fire
Tell Bruhmilda to go home, tell her that she is the one
Tell Bruhmilda to go home, and tell her that she is the one
Drawing circles on your body looking tonight for the sun
Find a map when its all foggy
What a shame if you are done
Ways to close and holes to jump in
The dragon is the one who one, the dragon is the one who won
Tell Bruhmilda to go home, tell her that she is the one
Tell Bruhmilda to go home, and tell her that she is the one
