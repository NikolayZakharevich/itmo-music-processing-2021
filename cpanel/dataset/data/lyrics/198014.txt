Corrupt, you corrupt
And bring corruption to all that you touch
Hold, you’ll behold
And beholden for all that youve done
And spell, cast a spell
Cast a spell on the country you run
And risk, you will risk
You will risk all their lives and their souls
And burn, you will burn
You will burn in hell, yeah you’ll burn in hell
You will burn in hell,
Yeah you’ll burn in hell for your sins
And our freedom’s consuming itself
What have we become?
It’s contrary to what we want
Take a bow
Live, you bring death
And destruction to all that you touch
Pay, you must pay
You must pay for your crimes against the earth
Hacks, feed the hacks,
Feed the hacks on the country you love
And beg, you will beg
You will beg for their lives and their souls
Yeah and burn, you will burn
You will burn in hell, yeah you’ll burn in hell
You’ll burn in hell, yeah you’ll burn
