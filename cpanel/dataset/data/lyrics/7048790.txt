I was working in the lab
Late one night
When my eyes beheld and eerie sight
For my monster in his lab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise.
(he did the mash) He did the monster mash
(the monster mash) It was a graveyard smash
(he did the mash) It caught on in a flash
(he did the mash) He did the monster mash
(wa-oo) From my laboratory in the castle East
(wa-oo) To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
(wa, wa-oo) To ghouls all came from their humble abodes
(wa-oo) To get a jolt, from my electrobes
(they did the mash) They did the monster mash
(the monster mash) It was a graveyard smash
(they did the mash) It caught on in a flash
(they did the mash) They did the monster mash
(wa-ooo) The zombies were having fun
(anashoop wa-oo) The party had just begun
(anashoop wa-oo) The guests included wolfman
(anashoop wa-oo) Dracula and his son
(wa-ooo) The scene was rocking, oh we’re digging the sounds
(wa-oo) Eagor on chains backed by asbaying hounds
(wa-oo) The coffin bangers were about to arrive
(wa-oo) With their vocal group, the crypt kicker five
(they played the mash) They played the monster mash
(the monster mash) It was a graveyard smash
(they played the mash) It caught on in a flash
(they played the mash) They played the monster mash
(its now the mash) Its now the monster mash
(the monster mash) And its a graveyard smash
(its now the mash) It’s caught on in a flash
(its now the mash) Its now the monster mash
(wa-oo) Now everything’s cool, Drac’s a part of the band
(wa-oo) And my monster mash is the hit of the land
(wa, wa-oo) For you the living, this mash was meant too
(wa-oo) When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you
(Then you can mash) Then you can monster mash
(the monster mash) and do my graveyard smash
(then you can mash) You’ll catch on in a flash
(then you can mash) Then you can monster mash
