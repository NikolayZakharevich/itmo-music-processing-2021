A shooting star in the sky
Something in my mind told me
That you came to talk to me
O! my little beloved Creole
A shooting star in the sky
Something in my mind told me
That you came to talk to me
O! my little beloved Creole
I fell asleep and I dreamed that one day
I’ll meet this little Creole
In a dream, she appeared to me as a fairy
And actually, she matched reality
I fell asleep and I dreamed that one day
I’ll meet this little Creole
In a dream, she appeared to me as a fairy
And actually, she matched reality
Unrivalled sweet flower
Captivating-eyed Creole
Flower among the thorns
Who changed my life
Unrivalled sweet flower
Captivating-eyed Creole
Flower among the thorns
Who changed my life
I fell asleep and I dreamed that one day
I’ll meet this little Creole
In a dream, she appeared to me as a fairy
And actually, she matched reality
I fell asleep and I dreamed that one day
I’ll meet this little Creole
In a dream, she appeared to me as a fairy
And actually, she matched reality
Unrivalled sweet flower
Captivating-eyed Creole
Flower among the thorns
Who changed my life
Unrivalled sweet flower
Captivating-eyed Creole
Flower among the thorns
Who changed my life
I fell asleep and I dreamed that one day
I’ll meet this little Creole
In a dream, she appeared to me as a fairy
And actually, she matched reality
I fell asleep and I dreamed that one day
I’ll meet this little Creole
In a dream, she appeared to me as a fairy
And actually, she matched reality
