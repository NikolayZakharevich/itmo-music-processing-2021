Hold up Hold on Dont be scared
You’ll never change whats been and gone
May your smile (may your smile)
Shine on (shine on)
Dont be scared (don't be scared)
Your destiny may keep you warm
'Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You’ll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Get up (get up)
Come on (come on)
Why’re you scared? (I'm not scared)
You’ll never change
Whats been and gone
'Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You’ll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
'Cos all of the stars
Are fading away
Just try not to worry
You’ll see them some day
Take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
We’re all of us stars
We’re fading away
Just try not to worry
You’ll see us some day
Just take what you need
And be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
