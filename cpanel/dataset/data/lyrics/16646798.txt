A sacrifice to live right
Like a slave under a dark mind
I will always search my way
I can see it so bright
By spending time in your life
I'm getting stronger day by day

The key will soon be turning
Into that fire burning wild
So much for that pain and learning
Here I come, the devil's child

Demons crying out your name
A forcing vengeance set to play
I feel my heartbeat rising
Get up-up-up, now get up-up-up
Knowledge failed, help was too late
Now everyone here has got to pay
Bleed for me, I am the world

Acceptance is a breakthrough
Please me or fall through
Die here in my arms
I said I will never love you
But maybe I'll show you the real you
Listen to my hollow heart

The key will soon be turning
Into that fire burning wild

Demons crying out your name
A forcing vengeance set to play
I feel my heartbeat rising
Get up-up-up, now get up-up-up
Knowledge failed, help was too late
Now everyone here has got to pay
Bleed for me, I am the world

I am the world
