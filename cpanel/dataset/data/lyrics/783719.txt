I walk the line, the line I choose,
I see the people in front of me,
I climb the wall, the wall of news,
I watch them show the tragedy,
If you were me could you defend,
The given rights to all of men,
Let’s fuck the world with all its trend,
They say it’s all about to end,
They say it’s all about to end,
They say,
They say,
There’s a prison that’s gone, but the fear lives on,
I want you walking on the dotted line,
Maybe you don’t see, what’s in front of me,
Maybe you won’t stand the test of time.
For we live in sin,
For we will win,
I watch the president kiss his family,
For we live in sin,
For we will win,
I watch the president,
Fuck society,
If you were me could you defend,
The given rights to all of men,
Let’s fuck the world with all its trend,
They say it’s all about to end,
They say it’s all about to end,
They say,
They say,
I’ve fallen in love with the old times,
I’ve never mentioned my own mind,
Let’s fuck the world with all its trend,
Thank God it’s all about to end,
They say it’s all about to end,
They say,
They say,
They say,
They say,
They say it’s all about to end.
