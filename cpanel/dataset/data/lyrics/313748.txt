We saw the holy men
Come in from Sanchi
We touched their souls
And heard the Martyrs crying
Among the fields of red
We took the strange brew
The windless sky diwali
Moon were calling to me The deeper I go The higher I fly with you
You take my breath away
You take my breath away…
You take my breath away
