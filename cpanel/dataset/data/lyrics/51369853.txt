Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it
In your pocket
Takin' this one to the grave
If I show you
Then I know you
Won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead

Why do you smile like you've been told a secret?
Now you're tellin' lies 'cause you have sworn to keep it
But no one keeps a secret, no one keeps a secret
Why when we do our darkest deeds do we tell?
They burn in our brains, become a living hell
'Cause everybody tells, everybody tells

Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it
In your pocket
Takin' this one to the grave
If I show you
Then I know you
Won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead

Look into my eyes, now you're getting sleepy
Are you hypnotized by secrets that you're keeping?
I know what you're keeping, I know what you're keeping

Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it
In your pocket
Takin' this one to the grave
If I show you
Then I know you
Won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead

"Denmark?"
"Yes, Winter?"
"I have something I want to tell you, but you have to promise to never tell anyone."
"I promise."
"Do you swear on your life?"
"I swear on my life."
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell
You swore you'd never tell

Got a secret
Can you keep it?
Swear this one you'll save
Better lock it
In your pocket
Takin' this one to the grave
If I show you
Then I know you
Won't tell what I said
'Cause two can keep a secret if one of them is dead

Yes, two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Yes, two can keep a secret if one of us is dead
