Oooooh
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm begging

Riding high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Walked away, won me then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling

I need you, (yeah) to understand
Tried so hard
To be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling

An empty shell
I used to be
Shadow of my life
Was hanging over me

A broken man
Without a none
Won't even stand the devil's dance
To win my soul

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling

I'm fighting hard
To hold my own
No, I just can't make it
All alone

I'm holding on
I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring
Is a shade of black

Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Begging, begging you
Put your loving hand out darling
