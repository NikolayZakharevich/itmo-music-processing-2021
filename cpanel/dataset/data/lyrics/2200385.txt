They built you a cage of diamonds and gold
Most beautiful place for you to grow old
They brought you the moon and served you the lie
And all that you wanted was freedom to fly

It's heavy
But you are not the only one
Who's tired of giving
Afraid of the oblivion
Could it be that your curse is a bliss?
But the crown on your head never felt this heavy

Harness your rage, take a leap of faith
To claim back you soul before it's too late
Show them no fear, sing them goodbye
Leave all but your heart and you're free to fly

It's heavy
But you are not the only one
Who's tired of giving
Afraid of the oblivion
Could it be that your curse is a bliss?
But the weight of the wolrd never felt this heavy

Take the evident leap of faith
Don't you be afraid


It's heavy
But you are not the only one
Who's tired of giving
Afraid of the oblivion
Could it be that your curse is a bliss?
But the cross that you bear never felt this heavy

You are not the only one
Who's tired of living
Afraid of the oblivion
Cause the crown on your head, the smile that you wear
The cross that you bear never felt this heavy

The crown on your head never felt this
Heavy
