Laduma was a boy who grew up in the heartland
And in the morning he’d speak to his heart and
Come the evening she’d tell him a story
And it would bring up his deepest dream
Laduma follow your star
Oh the goal’s in your heart
Laduma follow your star
Laduma
Laduma follow your star
Oh the goal’s in your heart
Laduma follow your star
Laduma
Comes a time when a boy must reach manhood
She had helped him as much as she could
All the while in the face of the wide world
He heard a voice and he knew he’d been called
Laduma follow your star
Oh the goal’s in your heart
Laduma follow your star
Laduma
Laduma follow your star
Oh the goal’s in your heart
Laduma follow your star
Laduma
Now’s the time, now’s the place on the goal line
He looks within and sees the crowd all around
He stands alone and in the moment his star shines
He hears the words at the back of his mind
Laduma follow your star
Oh the goal’s in your heart
Laduma follow your star
Laduma
Laduma follow your star
Oh the goal’s in your heart
Laduma follow your star
Laduma
