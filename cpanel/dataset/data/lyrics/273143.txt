Twenty tiny fingers, Twenty tiny toes
Two angel faces, Each with a turned up nose
One looks like Mommy, With a cute little curl on top
And the other ones got, A big bald spot
Exactly like his Pop Pop Pop, Pop a da Pop Pop, Pop Pop
I put on the light in the middle of the night and whispered "Dear lets go!"
He grabbed his sock and called the Doc, He told me "Don't be slow!"
He got me there with time to spare and then he sat on pins
Until the doctor shook his hand and told him "You've got twins!"
Twenty tiny fingers, Twenty tiny toes
Two angel faces, Each with a turned up nose
One looks like Mommy, With a cute little curl on top
And the other ones got, A big bald spot
Exactly like his Pop Pop Pop, Pop a da Pop Pop, Pop Pop
We've got cribs and bottles and bibs, all round our three room flat
No time to see what's on TV, no room to swing a cat
We're on the run, we're never done, it's like a steeplechase
Oh they came in and they took over like they owned the place
Twenty tiny fingers, Twenty tiny toes
Two angel faces, Each with a turned up nose
One looks like Mommy, With a cute little curl on top
And the other ones got, A big bald spot
Exactly like his Pop Pop Pop, Pop a da Pop Pop, Pop Pop
Twice the laundry, twice the milk, it's twice the baby clothes
Its double this and double that, oh how the money goes
But Pa and me, we both agree, when all is said and done
We've got twice the blessings and we've got twice the fun.
Twenty tiny fingers, Twenty tiny toes
Two angel faces, Each with a turned up nose
One looks like Mommy, With a cute little curl on top
And the other ones got, A big bald spot
Exactly like his Pop Pop Pop, Pop a da
Pop Pop, Pop Pop a da
Pop Pop
