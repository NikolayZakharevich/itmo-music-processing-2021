You're just too good to be true
can't keep my eyes off you
you'd feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
at long last love has arrived
and I thank God I'm alive
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
there's nothing else to compare
the sight of you makes me weak
there are no words left to speak
but if you feel like I feel
please let me know that it's real
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
and let me love you, baby, let me love you...

You're just too good to be true
can't keep my eyes off of you
you'd feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
at long last love has arrived
and I thank god I'm alive
you're just too good to be true
can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
oh pretty baby, now that I've found you, stay
and let me love you, baby, let me love you...
