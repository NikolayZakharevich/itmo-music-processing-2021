Tell all the children to lock those doors
I seen the smoke in the sky before
Gotta be up on my feet when the morning comes
'Cause this fight we can't ignore
I feel a chill building up inside
Seein' the sweat fillin' up my eyes
Tell every friend, enemy and flesh and blood
To send out the battle cry

Fingers stretching out from nowhere
Reaching for my throat
They're hungry for my skin
Teeth wide, smiling that they found me
Circlin' around me, slowly closing in
While you say

Everything is gonna be fine
Everything is gonna be fine
Fine, fine

Fingers stretching out from nowhere
Reaching for my throat
They're hungry for my skin, my skin
Teeth wide, smiling that they found me
Circlin' around me, slowly closing in
And you say

Tell all the children to lock those doors
I seen the smoke in the sky before
Gotta be up on my feet when the morning comes
This light we can't ignore
I feel a chill building up inside
Seein' the sweat fillin' up my eyes
Tell every friend, enemy and flesh and blood
To send out the battle cry

Everything is gonna be fine, fine
Everything is gonna be fine
Fine, fine, fine, fine

Fine, fine, fine, fine
Fine, fine

Everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine

Tell all the children to lock those doors
I seen the smoke in the sky before
Gotta be up on my feet when the morning comes
This light we can't ignore
I feel a chill building up inside
Seein' the sweat fillin' up my eyes
Tell every friend, enemy and flesh and blood
To send out the battle cry

Everything will be just fine
Everything will be just fine
