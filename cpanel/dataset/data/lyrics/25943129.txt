If only we could fly
Limp Bizkit style
John Otto
Take em to the Matthews Bridge
Can you feel it?
My g-g-g-generation

Get up!
My g-g-g-generation

Are you ready?
Do you know where you are?
Welcome to the jungle punk
Take a look around
It's Limp Bizkit
F*ckin' up your town
We downloaded the Shockwave
For all the ladies in the cave
To get your groove on
And maybe you're the one
Who flew over the cuckoo's nest
But guess who's next? (who?)
Generation X
Generation Strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane

So go ahead and talk sh*t
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk sh*t
About my g-g-generation

Cause we don't, don't give a f*ck, and
We won't ever give a f*ck
Until you, you give a f*ck about me
And my generation

Hey kid, take my advice
You don't want to step into a big pile of sh*t
Captain's drunk
Your world is Titanic
Floating on the funk
So get your groove on
And maybe I am just a little f*cked up
Life's just a little f*cked up
Generation X
Generation Strange
Sun don't even shine through our window pane

So go ahead and talk sh*t
Talk shit about me
Go ahead and talk sh*t
About my g-g-generation

Cause we don't, don't give a f*ck, and
We won't ever give a f*ck
Until you, you give a f*ck about me
And my generation

We don't, don't give a f*ck, and
We won't ever give a f*ck
Until you, you give a f*ck about me
And my generation

Who gets the blame? (Who gets the blame?)
You get the blame
And I... Get the blame
Who gets the blame? (Who gets the blame?)
You get the blame
And I... Get the blame
But do you think we can fly? (away, away)
Do you think we can fly? (away)
Do you... think we can fly?
Well I do
I do
Fly!

DJ Lethal... Bring it on!

Oooh yeah!
Come on!

So go ahead and talk sh*t
Talk sh*t about me
And go ahead and talk sh*t
About my g-g-generation

Cause we don't, don't give a f*ck, and
We won't ever give a f*ck
Until you, you give a f*ck about me
And my generation

We don't, don't give a f*ck, and
We won't ever give a f*ck
Until you, you give a f*ck about me
And my generation

Oh yeah
