Thanks for calling and letting me know
That your heart's not in it and you're letting me go
We've been here before and it didn't work, didn't work
Don't tell me again that it's not enough, not enough
Not enough

Rewind those moments again
When you felt at ease in my home
Take it back to the day
When it didn't feel dead, it felt wrong
Rewind those moments again
When you felt at ease in my home
Take it back to the day
Back to the day

I can feel the cold wind calling my name
See those black clouds raining on me
And for a reason now I know you did wrong
So I just ha-ha-ha-ha-have to let you go

Watch it
Rough and rugged, and I be rough and rugged
Rough, rugged, mi seh mi rough and rugged
