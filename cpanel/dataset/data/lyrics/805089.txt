This is how I show my love
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my A.D.D. baby
This is how an angel cries
I blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my A.D.D. baby
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself
Blame it on my A.D.D. baby
Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my A.D.D. baby
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
la la la la la
la la la la la oh
la la la la la
la la la la la oh
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail!
Sail with me into the dark
Sail!
Sail with me into the dark
Sail!
Sail with me into the dark
Sail!
Sail with me, sail with me
Sail!
