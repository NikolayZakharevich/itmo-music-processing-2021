Have love, will travel
Have love, will travel
Saying, need love
And baby, mmm mmm, I'll travel

Well I traveled from Maine to Mexico
Just to find a little girl who let me so
No matter where, no matter where I'll be
I'm looking for a woman that will satisfy me

Have love, will travel
Yeah baby, will travel
Have love, will travel
Yeah baby, will travel
Saying if you need a loving
Baby, mmm mmm, I'll travel
Oh, shake it, woo!

Have love, will travel
Yeah baby, will travel
Have love, will travel
Yeah baby, will travel
Saying if you need a loving
Baby, mmm mmm, I'll travel

Well I might take a bus or I'll take a plane
I might hitchhike or take a railroad train
Your kind of love drives a man insane
So looking for me walking any old way

Have love, will travel
Yeah baby, will travel
Have love, will travel
Yeah baby, will travel
Saying if you need a loving
Baby, mmm mmm, I'll trave
