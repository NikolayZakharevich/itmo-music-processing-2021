Put a glass box around her
And she’ll break the glass
If you try to cage her in
She’ll light the match
Oh, she’s like an animal
It’s in her blood
She will turn every chain into dust
Into dust
Into dust
Like the wind to streak
Like the water’s deep
She’s a bird
Mirage
If you try to tame
What is in her veins
Watch her turn your world
Into dust
Into
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Into dust
Into
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Into dust)
Like the wind to streak
Like the water’s deep
She’s a bird
Mirage
If you try to tame
What is in her veins
Watch her turn your world
Into dust
Into
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Into dust
Into
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Into dust)
The queen of hearts will light our stars
Like Cleopatra waging wars
A goddess in the human form
The queen of hearts will light our stars
Like Cleopatra waging wars
A goddess in the human form
Into dust
Into
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Into dust
Into
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Into dust)
