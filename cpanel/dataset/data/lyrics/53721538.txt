Forged in blood, etched in bone
The sacrifice, the war we know
I can feel it in my veins
Laced with gold but rich with pain
Do you want it?
Die for it
Nothing is ever given 'til you work for it
The choices that we make
Echo eternity
I’m not afraid to stand up, fists up
Never gonna give up
I’m lightning, no fear, just adrenaline
Jet black, heart attack
Thunder for a soundtrack
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Hey)
What kind of scars will you leave? (Hey)
What kind of blood will you bleed? (Hey)
When fear sets the stage for defeat (Hey)
What will your legacy be?
The darkest nights, the bitter cold
Live or die, our truth be told
I can hear it in my chains
A requiem for better days
And I will fear not my death or destiny
Because death fears me
I’m not afraid to stand up, fists up
Never gonna give up
I’m lightning, no fear, just adrenaline
Jet black, heart attack
Thunder for a soundtrack
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Hey)
What kind of scars will you leave? (Hey)
What kind of blood will you bleed? (Hey)
When fear sets the stage for defeat (Hey)
What will your legacy be?
What will I become?
Forsaken or beloved?
Too far away to touch
What will I become?
So everybody stand up, fists up
Never gonna give up
I’m lightning, no fear, just adrenaline
Jet black, heart attack
Thunder for a soundtrack
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa)
(Hey)
Deep are the scars I will leave (Hey)
Black is the blood I will bleed (Hey)
Yeah, nothing will hide underneath (Hey)
What will my legacy be?
