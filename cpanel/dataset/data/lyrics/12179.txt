Four corners
Funky, funky, funky four corners
It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around and finally found
Somebody who could make me feel blue, could make me be true
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you
Some others I’ve seen might never be mean
Might never, ever be cross or try to be boss
But they, they wouldn’t do for nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, baby, I love you still
It had to be you, it had to be you, it had to be you
Shoo-ba-doo-ba-doo, it had to be you, it had to be you
Wandered around and finally found
Somebody who could make me feel blue, hey, could make me be true
Even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you
Shoo-ba-doo-ba
Some others I’ve seen, might never be mean, don’t be so mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss
But they, they wouldn’t do
But nobody else gave me that look or thrill, ow
With all your faults, woman, I love you still
It had to be, it had to be, it had to be you, hey, hey
It had to be you, it had to be you, hey
I said, it had to be, had to be, it had to be you
You doggone, woman, you, heh heh heh, ow
