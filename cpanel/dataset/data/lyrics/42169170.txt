Are you watching me, watching you
Are you working out what to do
Are you thinking who's
Watching you, watching me

Are you on the haunt to catch a perfect sin
Let me crawl a little-bit under your skin
Babe, all I need is good loving, so let's go

There you are again moving inside my head
Cause you always put my heart under attack
Babe can't you see that I'm watching you again

Are you watching me, watching you
Are my silent thoughts coming true
Are you wondering who's
Watching you, watching me

Are you watching me, watching you
Are you working out what to do
Are you thinking who's
Watching you, watching me

Then you that tell that you push my emotions high
And I held my eyes on you just for a while
Babe, I can feel that you're running through my veins

Release yourself and let me guide you at my way
And I promise that you will be there someday
I know that your lips will taste like honey
Are you watching me, watching you
Are my silent thoughts coming true
Are you wondering who's
Watching you, watching me

Are you watching me, watching you
Are you working out what to do
Are you thinking who's
Watching you, watching me
