Memories Are Made Of This
Take one fresh and tender kiss, add one stolen night of bliss,
One girl, one boy, some grief, some joy, memories are made of this.
Don’t forget a small moonbeam, fold in lightly with a dream,
Your lips and mine, two sips of wine, memories are made of this.
Then add the wedding bells, one house where lovers dwell,
Three little kids for the flavor, stir caref’lly through the days,
See how the flavor stays, these are the dreams you will savor.
With His blessings from above, serve it gen’rously with love,
One man, one wife, one love through life, memories are made of this.
