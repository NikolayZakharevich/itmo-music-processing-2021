Try to remember the kind of september
When life was slow and so mellow
Try to remember the kind of september
When grass was green and the grain was yellow

Try to remember the kind of september
When you were youg and the callow fallow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow

Try to remember when life was so tender
When no one worked exept the willow
Try to remember when life was so tender
When dreams were kept beside your pillow

Try to remeber when life was so tender
When love was an ember about to billow
Try to remmber and if you remember
Then follow follow

Deep in december, it' s nice to remember
Althought you know the snow will follow
Deep in december, it' s nice to remember
Without the hurt the heart will follow

Deep in december it's nice to remember
The fire of september that made you mellow
Deep in december our hearts should remember
Then follow, follow
