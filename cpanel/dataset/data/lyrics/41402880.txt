Life it’s a candy
With a red hot chilli papper
Filling inside
Life! Are you ready
You’ll be a butterfly in the ultimat fight
Life treats you gently like
Virgin Mary
But then strikes back
Like Chriss Eubank
Life
It is full of surprise
Crossroad to hell
or papadise
But little did I know
Mr. Preacher man
What real life could do
And shit could hit the fan
Life is beyond peace and war
Destiny and God
I remember that time
When Life was a miracle
As if Zidane played for Liverpool
Life is a buisness
Risky and confused
God gave you a deal
That you cannot refuse
Life is a Terrorism
Globalisam Optimism
Give peace a chance
Give war romance
But little did I know
Mr. Preacher man
What real life could do
And shit could hit the fan
Life is beyond peace and war
Destiny and God
I remember that time
When Life was a miracle
And pigs might fly that was credible
But little did I know
Mr. Preacher man
What real life could do
And shit could hit the fan
Life is beyond peace and war
Destiny and God
I remember that time
When Life was a miracle
