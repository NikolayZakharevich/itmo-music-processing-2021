I’m on a mission
To see whatЂ™s been missing
My favorite song is on repeat
But itЂ™s just not helping me
My eyes have been wider but never been brighter
Something else is going on
I need a reminder of why I feel this way
ThereЂ™s a fine line between
Living a lie and feeling alive
There are times that I’ve been
Looking from the outside in
And here I go again
Falling behind losing my mind
I’m pretending itЂ™s alright
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
Wo-oh
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
I still believe in
Facing all my demons
And everything that people promise
Everything IЂ™ve always wanted
My mouth has been open
My words have been stolen
It may have been used against me
ItЂ™s starting to affect me
And now I feel this way
ThereЂ™s a fine line between
Living a lie and feeling alive
There are times that IЂ™ve been
Looking from the outside in
And here I go again
Falling behind losing my mind
I’m pretending itЂ™s alright
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
Wo-oh
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
And it goes like thisЂ¦
And it takes me backЂ¦
And it spins around
And round and round
And round and round
And it goes around
And always leads to black
ThereЂ™s a fine line between
Living a lie and feeling alive
There are times that IЂ™ve been
Looking from the outside in
And here I go again
Falling behind losing my mind
I’m pretending itЂ™s alright
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
Wo-oh
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
