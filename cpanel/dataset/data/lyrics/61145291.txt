I got a good good, a good feelin', yeah
I got a good good, a good feelin' (Hmm)
I got a good good, a good feelin' (Hmm)
Yeah, I'm up on a cloud, ain't comin' back down

I got a good good, a good feelin', yeah
Yeah, I'm up on a cloud, ain't comin' back down

Feel it in my bones, gotta shake it out
I'm going harder than before, let me hear you shout
I run round the whole world
Chasin' that thrill
From the bottom to the top, I'm finna knock it out
I'm about to blow!
Ready on the go
Steady shining brighter than I ever did before
When I'm up in the clouds
And I ain't comin' down
No I ain't comin' down
Oh no!

I'm the talk of the town (Woo!)
I know you're feelin' it now (Woo!)
Come on and move to the sound
And keep it goin', keep it goin'
And turn it up loud!
(Ohh-oh)
I got a good good, a good feelin', yeah
Yeah, I'm up on a cloud, ain't comin' back down
I got a good good, a good feelin', yeah
Yeah, I'm up on a cloud, ain't comin' back down

Startin' at the tip of my toes
Feel it in my head and my clothes, oh no!
Ain't nothin' holdin' me back
So I don't gotta hear all that smack, no more
Play it loud when I when walk in the door
I got the pedal pushed down to the floor
And I'm about to bring it home
Yeah, it's time to let them know
Yeah, it's time to them know
So let's go

I'm the talk of the town
I know you're feelin' it now
Come on and move to the sound
And keep it goin', keep it goin'
And turn it up loud!
(Ohh-oh)
I got a good good, a good feelin', yeah
(Ohh-oh)
Yeah, I'm up on a cloud, ain't comin' back down
I got a good good, a good feelin', yeah
Yeah, I'm up on a cloud, ain't comin' back down

(Ohh-oh)
I got a good good, a good feelin'
(Ohh-oh)
I got a good good, a good feelin'
(Ohh-oh)
I got a good good, a good feelin'
(Ohh-oh)
I got a good good, a good feelin'
