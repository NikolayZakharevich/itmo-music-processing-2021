Daytime, nighttime
Each day through, darling how I hope that you

Care a little, care a lot
Let me love you, let me not
But that wouldn't change the way I care for you
That wouldn't make me think of someone new
Somehow I know I'd rather
Live life through with this crazy feeling I've got

Care a little, care a lot
Just don't leave me on the spot
Tell me dear you're gonna let me have my chance
Tell me dear your heart is open to romance
But don't ever leave it up to circumstance
Care a little
Care a little
Care a little
Care a lot
