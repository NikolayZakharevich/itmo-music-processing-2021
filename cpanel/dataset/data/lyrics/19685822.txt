Come in, come in I’ll do the best I can
Come in, come in bring your whole bloody clan
Take it slow and easy and I’ll shake you by the hand
Sit you down I’ll treat you decent, I’m an Irishman
I’ve traveled East, I’ve traveled West, I’ve roamed from town to town
I’ve cut the harvest down in Clare, met people of renown
Where ever I went the welcome mat was always waiting me'
So fill your glass along with us and old Ireland free
Come in, come in I’ll do the best I can
Come in, come in bring your whole bloody clan
Take it slow and easy and I’ll shake you by the hand
Sit you down I’ll treat you decent, I’m an Irishman
When I am gone some other place and my memories going dim
Raise your glass and join the toast, invite the colleens in
Then think about the good old times and you’ll remember me
When good old songs were roaring out and the porter flowing free
Come in, come in I’ll do the best I can
Come in, come in bring your whole bloody clan
Take it slow and easy and I’ll shake you by the hand
Sit you down I’ll treat you decent, I’m an Irishman
Come in, come in I’ll do the best I can
Come in, come in bring your whole bloody clan
Take it slow and easy and I’ll shake you by the hand
Sit you down I’ll treat you decent, I’m an Irishman
