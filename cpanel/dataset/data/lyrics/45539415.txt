The night is young
At the Dazzler
I spiked my own drink
Took myself to bed
Alone I pondered the cheap thrills of hotels
The miniatures
The endless throw away towels
One from my hair
One from my foot
Another for my other foot
My face, my neck, my spilt beverages

Drunk in my hotel room
I look perfect
I look like I'm 24 before I caught your coldness
God I'm gorgeous
I keep begging for late checkouts
Let me stay here
Let me live here
In room 232 till I expire
I can shower for hours
Leave the lights on
I'm not paying those bills

The neighbours are quiet
No one is back yet
I think about the falsity of hotel sex
Expensive bed sheets
And the orange glowing filaments
The way you used to say you love me
In the heat of it
Holiday feeling
When it wasn't over too quick

Yeah I throw the TV out the window
And I'll paint the whole room of gold
I'm make potions with the minibar
Yeah I feel unbalanced
Put my feet on the walls
Trying to meet you all night
I'm not paying for calls

Oh
This is heaven
Alone

Yeah
This is living
Alone
