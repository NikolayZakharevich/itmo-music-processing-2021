One of these days girl, you’re gonna wake up.
And I wont be there to break your fall, or brush you off.
When you come back down, no I wont.
Would it kill you to show a little soft side.
It’s so attractive and sensual, it gets me off.
Isn’t that what you want? To get me off?
What will you do lover, when your looks fade?
And you cant use them to get your way and what you want.
Will you be so proud? No you wont.
Little girl so lost, your game is so tight.
Let you believe it yourself, and that just not right.
Don’t promise anything you can’t deliver to me.
One of these days girl, you’re going to clean house.
Will you be able to sleep at night with what you find?
Will it matter at all? Tell me now.
Would you sell your soul to live your dreams out?
Or would you hang on to you beliefs thats all you got.
Would you just breakdown, or hold you ground?
What would it be like if all the talk stopped?
No one cared what you did anymore, who would you be?
Would you even know? Probably not.
Little girl so lost, your game is so tight.
Let you believe it yourself, and that just not right.
Don’t promise anything you can’t deliver to me.
Little girl so lost, your gonna to burn out.
I hope it’s not to late for you to learn how
to be a woman, cuz in the end, that’s all I want.
