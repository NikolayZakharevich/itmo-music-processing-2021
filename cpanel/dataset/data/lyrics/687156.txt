What's up with my heart when it skips a beat (skips a beat)
Can't feel no pavement right under my feet (under my feet)

Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you (wah oooo)
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I don't want you now

When I'm down and my hands are tied (hands are tied)
I cannot reach a pen for me to draw the line (draw the line)
From this pain I just can't disguise
Its gonna hurt but I'll have to say goodbye

Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you (wah oooo)
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I dont want you now

Oh yeah

Ohhh Ohhhhh

Up in my lonely room
When I'm dreaming of you (wah oooo)
Oh what can I do
I still need you, but
I dont want you now
