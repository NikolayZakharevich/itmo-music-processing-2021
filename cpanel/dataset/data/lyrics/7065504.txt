I can remember when
You were always there
Everyday was made for you
You always felt my hand
Forever, I hear you say
That you needed me
Forever, I hear you say
That you can’t
When I needed your lovin'
You were always by my side
When I needed your lovin'
You were always by my side
Just way that love you show me
What it means to feel good
You opened up my world
And show me that we could
Be only won, be only know
Then you left me alone
When I needed your lovin'
You were always by my side
When I needed your lovin'
You were always by my side
By my side
By my side
