I understood loneliness before I knew what it was
Saw the pills on your table for your unrequited love
I would be nothing without you holding me up
Now I’m strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us

I am a giant. Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
I am a giant. We’ll be breaking boulders underneath our feet

I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant

Don’t hide your emotion, you can throw down your guard
And freed from the notion, we can be who we are
Oh you taught me something, that freedom is ours
It was you that taught me living is, togetherness, togetherness, togetherness

I am a giant. Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
I am a giant. We’ll be breaking boulders underneath our feet

I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, a giant
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, a giant

Going to shake, throw it away, in the dirt, under me, yeah
Going to shake, throw it away, in the dirt, under me, yeah
Going to shake, throw it away, in the dirt, yeah
Going to shake, throw it away, in the dirt, yeah
Going to shake, throw it away, in the dirt, yeah
Going to shake, throw it away, in the dirt, yeah

I am a giant.
I am a giant.
