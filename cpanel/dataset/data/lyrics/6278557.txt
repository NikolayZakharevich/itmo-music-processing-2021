I’m afraid of summer
Cuz you know I can’t swim
I get lost in the water
When the tide pulls me in
But lower gently
Her feet in the clay
She searches for answers
In a shadowy face
You can never go
The neighbors whisper
Wonder if they should care
Find her talking with noone
Softly kissing the air
Down the stairwell
The day that he left
Her body remembers
What her mind will forget
You can never go home
