A change of scene, a change of style
A change of hopes, with no regrets
A chance to watch, admire the distance
Still occupied, though you forget
Different colors, different shades
Over each mistakes were made
I took the blame
Directionless so plain to see
A loaded gun won’t set you free
So you say
Well share a drink and step outside
An angry voice and one who cried
I’ll give you everything and more
The strains too much, cant take much more
Oh, I’ve walked on water, run through fire
Cant seem to feel it anymore
It was me, waiting for me
Hoping for something more
Me, seeing me this time, hoping for something else
