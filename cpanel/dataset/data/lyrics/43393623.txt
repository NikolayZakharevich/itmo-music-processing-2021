I've gotta keep the calm before the storm
I don't want less, I don't want more
Must bar the windows and the doors
To keep me safe, to keep me warm
 
Yeah, my life is what I'm fighting for
Can't bar sea, can't reach the shore
And my voice becomes the driving force
I won't let this put me overboard
 
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown
It gets harder, I'll met you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
Don't let drown, drown, drown
(Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me drown)
 
So pull me up from down below
Cause I'm underneath the undertone
Can drive me off and hold me close
I need you now, I need you most
 
God, keep my head above water
Don't let me drown
It gets harder, I'll met you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
don't let drown, drown, drown
(don't let me, don't let me don't let me drown)
don't let drown, drown, drown
(don't let me, don't let me don't let me drown)
 
And I can't see in the stormy weather
I can't seem to keep it all together
And I, I can't the swim the ocean like this forever
And I can't breath
 
God, keep my head above water
I loose my breath
At the bottom
Come rescue me, I'll be waiting
I'm too young to fall asleep
 
God, keep my head above water
Don't le drown
It gets harder, I'll met you there at the altar
As I fall down to my knees
 
don't let drown
(don't let me, don't let me don't let me drown)
 
don't let drown
(don't let me, don't let me don't let me drown)
 
Keep my head above water
