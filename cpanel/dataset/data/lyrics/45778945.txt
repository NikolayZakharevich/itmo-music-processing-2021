De-de-de-de-de, bum-bum, ba-da
De-de-de-de-de, bum-bum, ba-da
We gonna make the girls dance

Ain't lookin' for enemies, but I ain't playin' nice (Mh-mhm)
The way you testin' me and look me in the eyes (Yeah)
Want some of my own candy, I love to see you try (Mhm)
Ain't nothin' real about the way you look tonight (Huhh, aight)

'Cause I know in the morning you'll be wakin' up all alone
Posin' all over your story with nothin' to hold but your phone
You got it bad all over your head
Are you obsessed? (Ohh)

Think that you cool, but you ain't got a crown
Be watchin' and learnin' 'cause I show you how
Lookin at me, like you want my man

What the fuck! (Ayy, ayy)
What the fuck! (Ayy, ayy)
What the fuck! (Ayy, ayy)
What the fuck! (Ayy, ayy)

Ain't lookin for drama, promise I'm not gon' compete (Ohh)
So keep on movin 'cause you got nothin' on me
Now, what you know about karma (Ayy), oh I heard she ain't so sweet (Ain't so sweet)
Get your self out of the club if you can't take the heat (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

'Cause I know in the morning you'll be wakin' up all alone
Posin' all over your story with nothin' to hold but your phone
You got it bad all over your head
Are you obsessed? (Ohh)

Think that you cool, but you ain't got a crown
Be watchin' and learnin' 'cause I show you how
Lookin at me, like you want my man

What the fuck! (Ayy, ayy)
What the fuck! (Ayy, ayy)
What the fuck! (Ayy, ayy)
What the fuck! (Ayy, ayy)
What the fuck! (De-de-de-de-de, bum-bum, ba-da)
What the fuck! (De-de-de-de-de, bum-bum, ba-da)
What the fuck! (De-de-de-de-de, bum-bum, ba-da)
What the fuck! (De-de-de-de-de, bum-bum, ba-da)

Another beat, another banger
We out here uniting the Hiphop and the House
Hot flood, for sure
What the fuck!
