The story was hopeless, the sign had been posted
He said to his mother «I think I’m going under»
They all heard the sirens, the people were crying
He said to his father «I'm not sure I can take this one much further»
Well they called him naive
They called him a saint and a sinner
All they could say «I'm both a loser and a winner»
Well they called him naive
They called him a saint and a sinner
All he could say «I'm both a loser and a winner»
The train left the station, the people were growing impatient
He said to his followers «I'm not sure I can lead you much further»
Well they called him naive
They called him a saint and a sinner
All they could say «I'm both a loser and a winner»
Well they called him naive
They called him a saint and a sinner
All he could say «I'm both a loser and a winner»
They called him naive, they called him a fool
They told him exactly what he must do
They called him naive, they called him a thief
They told him exactly what he must be
They called him naive, they told him insane
They told him exactly what he must say
They called him naive
Lightning struck the tower, the old ones fell from power
The story began again, when will it ever, ever end?
Well they called him naive
They called him a saint and a sinner
All they could say «I'm both a loser and a winner»
Well they called him naive
They called him a saint and a sinner
All he could say «I'm both a loser and a winner»
Well they called him naive
They called him a saint and a sinner
All they could say «I'm both a loser and a winner»
Well they called him naive
They called him a saint and a sinner
All he could say «I'm both a loser and a winner»
They called him naive, they called him a fool
They told him exactly what he must do
They called him naive, they called him a thief
They told him exactly what he must be
They called him naive, they told him insane
They told him exactly what he must say
They called him naive
