Got my own monster
Nobody but me
I would never call him enemy
He's the bad god I need

Losing my boundaries
Setting me free
Oh in my dreams he speaks to me
He's the bad god I need
He's the bad god I need

Monster
He's the bad god I need
I got my own Monster
He's the bad god I need
Monster
He's the bad god I need
I got my own Monster
He's the bad god I need

Got my own Angel
Nobody but me
I would never call her enemy
She's the good god I need

Holding me back
Just when I need
When I don't dream she's teaching me
She's the good god I need

Angel
She's the good god I need
I got my own Angel
She's the good god I need
Angel
She's the good god I need
I got my own Angel
She's the good god I need

But both of the sides
Fighting me
So Angel
Monster
Bye, bye

No

Both of the sides
Bye, bye
