Imagine me and you, I do. I think
About you day and night, it's only
Right to think about the girl I love
And hold her tight. So happy together.

If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you say you belong to me and ease my
Mind, imagine how the world could be, so
Very fine. So happy together.

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for
All my life. When you're with me, baby the
Skies'll be blue for all my life.

Me and you and you and me. No matter how
They tossed the dice, it had to be. The
Only one for me is you and you for me.
So happy together.

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for
All my life. When you're with me, baby the
Skies'll be blue for all my life.

Me and you and you and me. No matter how
They tossed the dice, it had to be. The
Only one for me is you and you for me.
So happy together.

Me and you and you and me. No matter how
They tossed the dice, it had to be. The
Only one for me is you and you for me.
So happy together.

So happy together. How is the weather?
We're happy together. So happy together.
Happy together. So happy together. So
Happy together
