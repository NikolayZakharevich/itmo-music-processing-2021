Boys, they're handsome and strong
But always the first to tell me I'm wrong
Boys try to tame me, I know
They tell me I'm weird and won't let it go

No, I'm fine, I'm lying on the floor again
Cracked door, I always wanna let you in
Even after all of this shit, I'm resilient

'Cause a princess doesn't cry (no-oh)
A princess doesn't cry (no-oh, oh)
Over monsters in the night
Don't waste our precious time
On boys with pretty eyes

A princess doesn't cry (no-oh)
A princess doesn't cry (no-oh, oh)
Burning like a fire
You feel it all inside
But wipe your teary eyes

'Cause princesses don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, oh
Don't cry
Don't cry, oh
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, oh
'Cause princesses don't cry

Girls, so pretty and poised
And soft to the touch
But God made me rough
Girls, so heavy the crown
They carry it tall
But it's weighing me down

No, I'm fine
I'm lying on the floor again
Cracked door
You're only going to let them in once
And you won't come undone

'Cause a princess doesn't cry (no-oh)
A princess doesn't cry (no-oh, oh)
Over monsters in the night
Don't waste our precious time
On boys with pretty eyes

A princess doesn't cry (no-oh)
A princess doesn't cry (no-oh, oh)
Burning like a fire
You feel it all inside
But wipe your teary eyes

'Cause princesses don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, oh
Don't cry
Don't cry, oh
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, oh
'Cause princesses don't cry

I'm fine, I won't waste my time
Keep it in a jar, gonna leave it for the next one
I'm fine, I won't waste my time
Keep it in a jar, gonna leave it for the next one

Yeah, I'm fine
I'm lying on the floor again

'Cause a princess doesn't cry (no-oh)
A princess doesn't cry (no-oh, oh)
Over monsters in the night
Don't waste our precious time
On boys with pretty eyes

A princess doesn't cry (no-oh)
A princess doesn't cry (no-oh, oh)
Burning like a fire
You feel it all inside
But wipe your teary eyes

'Cause princesses don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, oh
Don't cry
Don't cry, oh
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, oh

'Cause princesses don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, oh
Don't cry
Don't cry, oh
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, oh

'Cause princesses don't cry
