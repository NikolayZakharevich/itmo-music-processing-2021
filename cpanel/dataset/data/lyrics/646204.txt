Today was gonna be the day
That they’re gonna throw it back to you
By now you should’ve somehow
Realized what you’ve got to do
I don’t believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I’m sure you’ve heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
And I don’t believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk along are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don’t know how
So I said maybe
You’re gonna be the one who saves me?
And after all
You’re my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they’ll never throw it back to you
By now you should’ve somehow
Realized what you’ve got to do
I don’t believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we had to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
I don’t know how
So I said maybe
You’re gonna be the one that saves me?
And after all…
You’re my wonderwall
So I said maybe
You’re gonna be the one who saves me?
And after all…
You’re my wonderwall
So I said maybe
You’re gonna be the one who saves me?
And after all…
You’re my wonderwall
Said maybe
You’re gonna be the one that saves me You’re gonna be the one that saves me You’re gonna be the one that saves me
