See me riding through west-coast vibes
Sippin' my soul, glitter and gold
Cruisin' and growning, I'm hypnotised
just to feel alright

Turning on and off my high beam lights
(?) cocaine, straight to the brain
Banging on the dashboard losing my mind
Tryna feel alright

I don't need no honey right by my side
Bring me just anything, you know I'm feelin fine
Love it like the first time (woah)
Catch me on the west side (woah)

Holdin' on to the summer
Like pheromones right from a lover

It's chemical
It's chemical

I don't need no honey right by my side
Bring me just anything, you know I'm feelin fine
Love it like the first time (woah)
Catch me on the west side (woah)

Holdin' on to the summer
Like pheromones right from a lover
It's chemical 
It's chemical

Holdin' on to the summer
Like pheromones right from a lover (lover)
It's chemical
It's chemical
