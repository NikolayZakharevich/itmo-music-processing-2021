You try to find pro's but you only find con's
You're looking for perfection but you only see flaws
You try to be content but you end up being sad
You're looking for the body you already have
You think everything is wrong but it's all in your head
Way too many nights you've been crying in your bed
You tryna feel strong but you end up feeling weak
You and your emotions playing hide and seek

Words cannot describe what I wanna say to you

If I could be your mirror
You could see through my eyes
What a beautiful sight right in front of me
If only you could see
Oh, you could see it clearer
All those beautiful lies that you never believe
Baby, they are true
I'd show it all to you
If I could be your mirror
If I could be your mirror, oh

And darling, when we're older closing in on 85
You know all 'bout beauty and your beauty never dies
I'll tell you you're incredible, you're such a work of art
Little bit of heaven just the way you are
So let the world know there's no one like you
'Cause with a simple smile you can light up the room
Let yourself be loved 'cause you deserve it all
You're a little bit of heaven just the way you are

But words cannot describe what I wanna say to you

If I could be your mirror
You could see through my eyes
What a beautiful sight right in front of me
If only you could see
Oh, you could see it clearer
All those beautiful lies that you never believe
Baby, they are true
I'd show it all to you

I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause it wouldn't be you
If I could make you see
Just what you are to me
'Cause this is a reflection
And darling, you're perfection

If I could be your mirror
You could see through my eyes
What a beautiful sight right in front of me (Right in front of me)
If only you could see (If only you could see)
Oh, you could see it clearer
All those beautiful lies that you never believe
Baby, they are true (They are true)
I'd show it all to you (Show it all to you)
I wouldn't change a thing
'Cause it wouldn't be you
If I could be your mirror
