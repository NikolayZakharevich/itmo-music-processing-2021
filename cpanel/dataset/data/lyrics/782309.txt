Hey, do ya love me. I'm untouchable darkness
A dirty black river to get you through this
Hey, do ya love me I'm a devil machine
(hey do ya love me I'm a devil machine)
Get into my world all american dream

In the mouth of madness
Down in the darkness
No more tomorrow
Down in the hollow

Hey do ya love it when the kids are screaming
Wrecking on the road violate their dreaming
Hey, do ya love to see the filth in the clean
(hey do ya love to see the filth in the clean)
Get into the gone all american dream

In the mouth of madness
Down in the darkness
No more tomorrow
Down in the hollow

I'm demon speeding
I'm demon speeding
I'm demon speeding
I'm demon speeding

Get it on, get it on, get it on, get it on come alive

Hey, do ya love me elevating the madness
(Hey, do ya love me elevating the madness)
A super death rising to get you through this
(a super death rising to get you through this)
Hey, do ya love me like a beautiful fiend
Get into my world all american dream
