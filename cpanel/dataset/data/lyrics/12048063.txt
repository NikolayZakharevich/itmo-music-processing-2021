I remember when you moved so slow going to the show.
Always cooped up in your room with a bottle of whiskey every meal of June.
I don’t know those eyes.
Why you get so wasted all alone?
You’re burnin' out your light.
You just don’t seem oh so bright.
What do I have to do to keep your pride.
I’ll be by your side.
I don’t think Lee Hooker could ever sing the blues — not the way I do when I am
starin' right at you.
Oh mama please just hold me one more night before I lose you to the juice.
