Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playin' in the street, gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kickin' your can all over the place, singin'

We will, we will rock you
And we will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shoutin' in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Wavin' your banner all over the place, singin'

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleadin' with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back into your place, singin'

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you, ah

We will, we will
We will, we will
We will rock you
We will, we will
We will, we will
We will rock you
