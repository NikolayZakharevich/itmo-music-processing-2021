Not long ago I heard a song
Reminded me of how we lost our senses
The days were short, the nights were long
Wrong was nice, we sabotaged our chances

We lost control so easily
We fell in love to disagree
Locked the door and threw away the key

'Cause we were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish
Playing heart games just to bleed

All my memories are clouded by
Salty rivers, I don't cry, I'm tearless
I hide behind my entourage
Every day they tell me I am fearless

But when I close the door and I'm alone
The walls are closing in on me
It takes loneliness to see

That we were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish
Playing heart games just to bleed

You are on your knees, you are naggin' me, for sure
But we can go back to where the foolish people go
Now I'm on my knees, and I'm naggin' you, for sure
I can't go back, oh, can we go back?

'Cause we were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish
Playing heart games just to bleed

We were foolish
Such a shame we couldn't see
We were foolish
Playing heart games just to bleed
