Too bad they've heard your prayers
Only the stars witness
They run when she says yes, it’s
The first of many fears
One more kiss from his belt
Now she can tell her prayers
Too weak to cry for help
But no one really cares

She knows he lies
He goes every night
They fight, he slows
Who cries as she falls?
As she falls

Too bad they've heard your prayers
Only the stars witness
They run when she says yes, it's
The first of many fears
One more kiss from his belt
Now she can tell her prayers
Too weak to cry for help
But no one really cared

Too bad they’ve heard your prayers
Only the stars witness
They run when she says yes, it's
The first of many fears
One more kiss from his belt
Now she can tell her prayers
Too weak to cry for help

She knows he lies
He goes every night
They fight, he slows
Who cries as she falls?
As she falls
As she falls
As she falls
