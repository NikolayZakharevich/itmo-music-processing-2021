I wasn’t built for this my head can’t make any damn sense of this so it sings
Can’t remember the smell and I can’t recall the taste but I try everyday
If I wasn’t so afraid
I’d shine a light up to space
Then my soul could be
Strong enough to see your face
One more day
One more day
I found notes that you hid sharing secrets and fears that were meant to stay hid
Moving stuff out your room leaves me emptier than the room where you stayed
If I wasn’t so afraid
I’d shine a light up to space
Then my soul could be
Strong enough to see your face
Give me one more day
One more day (day)
And if I wasn’t so afraid
I’d shine a light up to space
Then my soul could be
Strong enough to see your face
One more day
