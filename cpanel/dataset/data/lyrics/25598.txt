If you ever get close to a human
And human behaviour
Be ready to get confused

There's definitely, definitely no logic
To human behaviour
But yet so, yet so irresistible
There's no map to human behaviour

They're terribly terribly moody
Oh, human behaviour
Then all of a sudden turn happy
But, oh, to get involved in the exchange
Of human emotions is ever so, ever so satisfying

There's no map and a compass
Wouldn't help at all
Human behaviour
Human behaviour

Human behaviour
Human behaviour
Human behaviour
