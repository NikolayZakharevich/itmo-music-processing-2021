So sweet so genuine.
I bet you taste like sweet cherry pie.
So gorgeous every man’s jaw drops.
When will you choose my straw.
So I find you put flowers to shame.
You’ve got all the guys playing your game.
In the moonlight I will ask you to dance.
Will you let me taste sweet romance.
I throw my penny into the wishing well.
What that wish was I will never tell.
Can I be by your side at night?
Can I be your everlasting light.
I will be your warrior.
I’ll be the one who takes care of you.
Just let me know when shit get tight.
Oh baby please just let me ignite.
I’ll be the one to control disease.
I’ll change the weather anytime you please.
Everyone will know your name if you please just be my queen.
I throw my faith into the wishing well.
What that wish was I will never tell.
Can I be by your side at night?
Can I be your everlasting light.
I throw my fate into that wishing well.
I pray to god that I don’t go to hell.
No no no…
I throw my fate into that wishing well.
I pray to god that I don’t go to hell.
No no no…
I throw my fate into that wishing well.
I pray to god that I don’t go to hell.
No no no…
I throw my penny into the wishing well.
What that wish was I will never tell.
Can I be by your side at night?
Can I be your everlasting light.
Can I be your everlasting light.
