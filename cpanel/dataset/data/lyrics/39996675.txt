I need emotion, Novocaine, I need a numbing of my brain
I need somethin' to take away the remains of your name
I need amnesia for a day and an umbrella for the rain
That hasn’t gone away since you said you didn’t need me
Lately been thinkin' maybe
There’s a place we won’t feel so crazy
Then in a hazy mid-morning daydream
I found a shady spot that they saved me
They said, «Come be the newest member of the broken hearts club
We hate every little thing about the people that we love
We’re the let-down, we’re the lied-to, where the lost go when it finds you
Where the lonely make the lonely feel less lonely, and we’re dyin' to
Invite you to stay, and take away the pain
'Cause misery loves company, so hey, what do you say?»
And at first I wasn’t sure if there’s even a cure
For what I’m feelin', 'cause what I’m feeling’s been feelin' more and more
absurd
The repeating in my head of every last word that you said
Feels like ever since you left, you still won’t leave me
And lately, been thinkin' maybe
There might be a place we won’t feel so crazy
For changing the way you made me
And in a daydream, I let them save me
I’m the newest member of the broken hearts club
We hate every little thing about the people that we love
We’re the let-down, we’re the lied-to, where the lost go when it finds you
Where the lonely make the lonely feel less lonely, and we’re dyin' to
Invite you to stay, and take away the pain
'Cause misery loves company, so hey, what do you say?
I guess if you can’t beat 'em, join 'em
That’s what they always say
Let’s go inside, let’s coincide
And all commiserate
Singin', we’re the newest members of the broken hearts club
We still feel pretty lonely and we wish we didn’t, but
We’re the newest members of the broken hearts club
And we all kinda hate it, but it’s easier than love
Singin', we’re the newest members of the broken hearts club
And we still feel pretty lonely and we wish we didn’t, but
We’re the newest members of the broken hearts club
And we all kinda hate it…
