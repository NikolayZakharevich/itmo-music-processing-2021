Iv been a wild rover for many a year,
and i spent all me money on whiskey and beer,
but now im returning with gold in great store,
and I swear ill never will play a wild rover no more,
And its no nay never, no nay never no more,
will i play a wild rover, no never no more,
I went into an ale house i used to freqent,
and i told the landlady me money was spent,
i asked her for credit she answered me nah,
said a custom like yours i can have anyday,
And its no nah never, no nay never no more,
will i play a wild rover, no never no more,
Well out of me pocket i took soverins bright,
and the land ladies eyes opend wide with delight,
she said i have the whiskeys and beers of the best,
and the words that i spoke they were only in jest
And its no nah never, no nay never no more,
will i play a wild rover, no never no more,
Ill go home to me parents confess what iv done,
and ill ask them to pardon there prodigle son,
and if they’ll forgive me as off time befor,
well i never will play a wild rover no more
And its no nah never, no nay never no more,
will i play a wild rover, no never no more,
one last time,
And its no nay never, no nay never no more,
will i play a wild rover, no never no more,
