You could open with your failings
Make them understand, show the love notes
Make them picture with their eyes closed
Make them wonder where the time goes
Keep your distance south of river
Draw a line, they are not together
Make it screech, stop, wait, turn red
Make me wonder where the time went
You will not save me a stand-off
Be not a stranger and land here
I will leave this empty-handed
Feeling selfish, common as shit
Leave me question where your heart lends
How you open-wounded withstand
Lead me into some false pretence
I will ruin you in a second
Leave it up to interpretation
Open-ended invitation
And your wedding, I could crash it
Whisper in your ear «God, I missed you
It’s been too much, I can’t stand it»
Then I cried there in the staff room
Selling my seats to your concert
I won’t stomach it if I see you
Walking so tall, I can’t reach you
Happier, pretty picture
With some new pretty little blue
You will not save me a stand-off
You will not save me a stand-off
