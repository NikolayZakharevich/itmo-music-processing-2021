Dress up for love, I’m coming from above
I keep my motor clean
Look out, below
All systems go full steam spacemachine
Dress up for love now, dress up for love
I keep my motor clean
Full steam spacemachine!
When you’re behind the wheel
Full steam spacemachine!
I love to lie
With Lucy in the sky
No one could ever know
In time and space
We’ll find a secret place
Where no one else can go Dress up for love now, dress up for fun
I keep my motor clean
Full steam spacemachine!
When you’re behind the wheel
Full steam spacemachine!
Ooh, close contact
And this is how we interact
I know that opposites attract
Time to feel your energy
Jamming my telemetry
Hard to starboard, stay the course
Hyperdrive me, use the force
Hard to starboard, stay the course
Hyperdrive me, no remorse
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, full steam spacemachine!
I don’t believe (Full steam spacemachine!)
I keep my motor clean (Full steam spacemachine!)
When you’re behind the wheel (Full steam spacemachine!)
You scream, I scream (Full steam spacemachine!)
I reign supreme (Full steam spacemachine!)
Two ships, tractor beam (Full steam double team!)
They will never catch us (Full steam spacemachine!)
Let’s go back to Uranus
Full steam spacemachine!
Full steam spacemachine!
