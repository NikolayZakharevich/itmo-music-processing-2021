Anna, you come and ask me girl 
To set you free, girl 
You say he loves you more than me 
So I will set you free 
Go with him (Anna) Go with him (Anna) 

Anna, girl, before go now 
I want you to know, now 
That I still love you so, 
But if he loves you more, 
Go with him 

All of my life 
I've been searching for a girl 
To love me like I love you 
oh now 
But every girl I ever had breaks my heart 
And leaves me sad, 
what am I, what am I supposed to do 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 

Anna, just one more thing girl

You give back your ring to me 
And I will set you free, 
go with him 

All of my life 
I've been searching for a girl 
To love me like I love you 
But let me tell you now 
But every girl I ever had breaks my heart 
And leaves me sad, 
what am I, what am I supposed to do 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 

Anna, just one more thing girl 
You give back your ring to me 
And I will set you free, 
go with him (Anna) 
go with him (Anna) 
You can go with him girl (Anna) 
go with him
