I want you to be true
'cause sometimes I don't understand
The things you do

I won't save you
From the ways you so so
Wrongly want to choose

If you blame your failures
On some other guys
Then I will not tell you how to survive

If you blame your failures
On some other guys
Then I cannot tell you how to survive

Yeah

Please don't try to
Pretend that you're alright
And there's nothing to lose

There is no way
You can fool me with
The bullshit that you say

If you blame your failures
On some other guys
Then I cannot tell you how to survive

If you blame your failures
On some other guys
Then I cannot tell you how to survive

Yeah

You never reach what you need
If you go on with this
You never reach what you need
If you go on with this
You never reach what you need
If you go on with this
You never reach what you need
If you go on with this

Everything just goes by
If you don't pay attention
Everything just goes by
If you don't pay attention
Everything just goes by
If you don't pay attention
Everything just goes by
If you don't pay attention
NOWLALALALLA
Pay attention now!
Lallalalllala
