I catch your eyes, try not to smile.
I check your style. I feel your wise.
We have a drink, then go outside.
Talk for a while, and then we... kiss!

We play the game, start to move.
I feel my heart, you feel the beat.
I take your hands, you turn around slow.
We start to feel,
It's time to go!

Right,
Morning will hit the sky,
And it's no surprise, I wake up with you!
Right, I shouldn't compromise,
I don't have to think twice, what to do!

You got me hypnotized!
You got me hypnotized!
You got me hypnotized!
So we know what to do!

You got me hypnotized!
You got me hypnotized!
You got me hypnotized!
So we know what to do!

So we slide into the night.
Into the while open slow
All starryeyed.
You see me glow.
So will I hide or will I show?

You watch me dance.
I feel you move.
You pull me nail. Nothing to feel.
We drift inside. The dream was sight.
Until we slide into the light.
