There's a pyramid of power with eyes that can see it all
Cameras to capture your image at City Hall
Realize they listen whenever you make a call
If you want a revolution, I'll really give it to y'all
Strength is the army that bands against bands
Of dead Presidents determining life of man
Kind of cancerous how we breathe vapors
Greed got us bleeding in streets for cheap paper

Assemble the masses, melt the plastic
Combine, realign when the shit gets drastic
Lift the veil, when the system's unmasked
It's just another pyramid scheme, a government racket

Devour the power with jaws Jurassic
Gnashing T-Rex with covert tactics
Rise from the ashes, take back the Atlas
Bring the madness

Bring the madness
Bring the madness
