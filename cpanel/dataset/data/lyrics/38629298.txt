I'm thirsty
I'll give you what you want if you want to
You got my full attention
I'm different though
I'd rather warn you so
You don't go crazy, crazy on me

You won't change me
Nor tame an only child
But you'd love to
I'm a lot like my dad
You still want me now do you?
Do you now?

I'm gonna make you right
It's that easy
You're not just somebody
Don't you worry 'bout me

Enough girl talk
I played the right cards, you keep shuffling
You got me wrapped up
I'll be careful though
Gave you my time so I'd fancy some
Some work in return

I ain't lonely
Brought up to live alone, I'll love you slowly
So before you act up, get all fired up
Better let you know
That I'm just trouble
Just trouble you know

I'm gonna make you right
It's that easy
You're not just somebody
Don't you worry 'bout me
