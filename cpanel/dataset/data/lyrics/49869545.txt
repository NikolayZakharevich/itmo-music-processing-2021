Ooh
Komm zu mir, komm zu mir
Ooh
Komm zu mir, komm zu mir

Come to me
Come to me
You're the only one
Give me love
Give me love
From the dusk till dawn
Come to me
Come to me
Boy we can get on
Give me love
Give me love
From the dusk till dawn

Falling through the floor
Baby, this is devil's door
Burning in the flame
Wanna know my secret?
Bang!

Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
Uh

I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me, boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me, boy

Falling through the floor
Baby, this is devil's door

Come to me
Come to me
You're the only one
Give me love
Give me love
From the dusk till dawn
Come to me
Come to me
Following my voice
Give me love
Give me love
You don't have a choice

Do you know me?
We'll take it really slowly
Falling through the floor
Ask the devil's door
You gotta know me
Just get the rhythm slowly
Burning in the flame
Wanna know my secret?
Bang!

Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom
Uh

I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me, boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me, boy

I'm so high
Love me, love me, love me, boy
I'm so fine
Love me, love me, love me, boy
Uh
Bang!
