Heh heh
They almost got me
Nobody said the war would be easy to win
Let’s go
I’m a get you off me
My Lord, since I can’t kill them softly
They die hard
See, they floating all around me
Cause they trying
To get inside my mind
Self-sabotaged, savage hard
Now I’m forced to map a course
Through the forest of my
It’s crazy because the saddest part is when the laughing starts
I had a spark but that was lost in the albatross
The guilt process tries to relinquish my options
Guess that I’ve been victimised by me thinking wise topics
Two psychiatrists enter with synchronized watches
Asking me what my eye optics see
How many purposely were buried in my word debris
Even I suffered extreme amounts of hurt from me
No disrespect to y’all Worldly universities
But they ain’t qualified to service these ghetto emergencies
The plotting heathen finally got even I’m trying but not breathing
The anxiety’s not leaving they ask me what I do at night for entertainment
I fight to maintain possession of my sainement
I’m a get you off me
My Lord, since I can’t kill them softly
They die hard
See, they floating all around me
Cause they trying
To get inside my mind
I’m a get you off me
My Lord, since I can’t kill them softly
They die hard
See, they floating all around me
Cause they trying
To get inside my mind
Tryna make it work but it’s not falling in line
Got people tryna tell me that it’s all in my mind
Everybody worried, keep calling and crying
Wanna check me out but I keep stalling for time
And money ain’t the remedy, I can’t let it tempt me
Bank account full but my soul is still empty
Ticking like a time bomb, my attitude is explosive
I’m the biggest enemy I got, I keep me the closest
Evil entities invade us but we can’t let 'em take us
Want the demons out your house, you gotta serve 'em the eviction papers
Say preacher, you ain’t doing what you should
Your church is empty cause your words don’t touch the hood
We suffocating, no ventilation, we all grieving
I’m tryna turn some lights on in my dark regions
Something calling me but I refuse to go
Trying not to lose it, bro
Thank God for music though
I’m a get you off me
My Lord, since I can’t kill them softly
They die hard
See, they floating all around me
Cause they trying
To get inside my mind
I’m a get you off me
My Lord, since I can’t kill them softly
They die hard
See, they floating all around me
Cause they trying
To get inside my mind
Yeah, gotta shake this demonic heat
Bad thoughts jigging at me when I’m tryna sleep
The wolf be disguised as an honest sheep
Looking like a pretty goldfish with some piranha teeth
I try reclining on the sideline constantly
Ain’t wanna work for my soul, I wanted something free
But in the end, cast out, I ain’t the one to be
I flipped the game around and made the devil run from me
Don’t be fooled just because they giving y’all bread
You’re not alive unless you know they want us all dead
Undetectable presence, you’ve never seen the blood
Cause it comes in the form of what you think you love
I walk around with my own guilt draped over my shoulder like a long quilt
But I ain’t sleeping in it, I’m a shed it gladly
Nice try, you almost had me
I’m a get you off me
My Lord, since I can’t kill them softly
They die hard
See, they floating all around me
Cause they trying
To get inside my mind
I’m a get you off me
My Lord, since I can’t kill them softly
They die hard
See, they floating all around me
Cause they trying
To get inside my mind
