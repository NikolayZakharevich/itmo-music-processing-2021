Farewell to Nova Scotia 
and to the coast bound sea 
Will you ever breathe a sigh, 
or have the wish for me. 

The sun is setting in the west 
The birds, they sing on every tree 
All nature seemed inclined to rest 
but there is still no rest for me. 

I grieve to leave my land 
to leave my family, 
I grieve to leave my man 
to my heart he holds the key. 

The sun is setting in the west 
The birds, they sing on every tree 
All nature seemed inclined to rest
but there is still no rest for me. 

I have three brothers dead 
their arms folded ore their chest 
They fell the deep blue sea 
that ocean put them to their rest. 

The sun is setting in the west 
The birds, they sing on every tree 
All nature seemed inclined to rest 
but there is still no rest for me. 

The sun is setting in the west 
The birds, they sing on every tree 
All nature seemed inclined to rest 
but there is still no rest for me.
