Let me sleep
I am tired of my grief
And I would like you
To love me, to love me, to love me
This is the night when these woods sigh
Come with me
There are people who cannot speak
Without smiling
They would take me from your hand
Or they would try, they would try
This is the murmur of the land
This is the sound of love’s marching band
And how they hold you like a gun
And how I sing you like a song
I heard when I was young
And buried for a night like this
