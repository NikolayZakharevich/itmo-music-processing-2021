Blue jeans, white shirt,
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn,
It was like James Dean, for sure,
You're so fresh to death & sick as ca-cancer.
You were sort a punk rock, I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater,
And I know that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day
We met in December,
Oh, baby...

I will love you till the end of time,
I would wait a million years.
Promise you'll remember that you're mine.
Baby, can you see through the tears,
Love you more than those bitches before.
Say you'll remember,
Ðžh, baby, say you'll remember.
I will love you till the end of time...

Big dreams, gangster said,
"You had to leave to start your life over".
I was like: "No, please, stay here,
We don't need no money, we can make it all work",
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday.
I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin'
But he was chasing paper.
"Caught up in the game", that was the last I heard.

I will love you till the end of time,
I would wait a million years.
Promise you'll remember that you're mine.
Baby, can you see through the tears,
Love you more than those bitches before.
Say you'll remember,
Oh, baby, say you'll remember.
I will love you till the end of time...

He went out every night.
And, baby, that's alright.
I told you that no matter what you did,
I'd be by your side
Cause I'm a ride or die,
Whether you fail or fly.
Well shit, at least you tried.
But when you walked out that door a piece of me died,
I told you I wanted more but that not what I had in mind.
I just want it like before,
We were dancin' all night.
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life.
You just need to remember....

I will love you till the end of time,
I would wait a million years.
Promise you'll remember that you're mine.
Baby, can you see through the tears,
Love you more than those bitches before.
Say you'll remember,
Oh, baby, say you'll remember.
I will love you till the end of time...
