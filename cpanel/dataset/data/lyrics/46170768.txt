Here she comes; she's cool like sin
I can feel my blood get thin
Here she comes; she'll suck me in
Take a deep breath and begin

She's wild-eyed and confident
Heard my words, knew what I meant
And you can be my only friend
When they dump me in the end

It isn't money why she sticks around
She's stuck in mud; she's trying to take me down

She behaves like she's on fire
On her tip-toes, reach up higher
And if the doctor can't do tricks
You can use your normal fix

And if she asks you why you can't complain
Just kiss her cheek and say you can today
And I can't wake her up, because she's already dead
I can't wake her up; did you hear what I said?

Here she comes; she's cool like sin
I can feel my blood get thin
Here she comes; she'll suck me in
Take a deep breath and begin
