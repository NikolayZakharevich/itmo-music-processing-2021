Listen, Baby
Ain't no moutain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry

Cause baby
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you
Remember the day
I set you free
I told you
You can always count on me, darlin
From that day on I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Some way some how

No wind, no rain
Or winters cold can stop me baby
No no baby
You are my goal
If your ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just sentence for me
Ooh baby
My love is a live
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
As fast as I can

Don't you know that
There ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you
