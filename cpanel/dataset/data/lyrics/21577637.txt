Summer’s here, winter’s gone
Finally I can see the sun
Every time you walk into the room
And all my fears disappear
When I’m in your atmosphere
I don’t know what it is you do
But you do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But you do
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I can’t explain why
It’s the way you are
It’s just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away
It’s the way you are
It’s just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away
Like an old radio
A song I just can’t let go
All I got on my mind is you
Movie stars and caviar
Couldn’t get me where you are
There’s nothing I could do about it
It’s the way you are
It’s just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away
And I’ll be right there
When you need someone to guide you
(Guide you)
Whatever it takes, girl
I will be doing it for you
(For you)
'Cause I’ve been acting like a fool
I wanna take my time and spent it all on you
So girl just come and sweep my feet off the ground
Like you do
It’s the way you are
It’s just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away
Hey, it’s the way you are
It’s just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away
Because it’s all about you
Because it’s all about you, girl
And I’m hanging on to every single word you say
It’s the way you are
It’s just the way that you are
That can make my day
The bad times go away
It’s the way you are
