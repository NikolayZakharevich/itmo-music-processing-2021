Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did you say?
(J-J-J-J-J.R.)
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmm, that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say
(Jason Derulo)
Mmmm, that it’s all for the best?
Of course, it is
I was so wrong for so long
Only tryna please myself
Girl, I was caught up in her lust
When I don’t really want no one else, so no
Know I should have treated you better
But me and you were meant to last forever
So let me in, give me another chance
To really be your man
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn’t know what to do, yeah
But when I become a star we’ll be living so large, I’ll do anything for you
So tell me, girl
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that you only meant well? (Well)
Well of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmmm, that it’s all for the best?
Of course it is
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did you say?
How could I live with myself
Knowing that I let our love go?
And ooh, what I’d do with one chance
I just gotta let you know
I know what I did wasn’t clever
But me and you we’re meant to be together
So let me in, give me another chance
To really be your man
'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn’t know what to do
But when I become a star we’ll be living so large, I’ll do anything for you
So tell me, girl
Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that you only meant well? (Mmmm. I only meant well)
Well of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Mmmm, that it’s all for the best? (Girl, it’s all for the best)
Of course it is (so what)
Mmmm, whatcha say (so what)
Mmmm, that you only meant well?
Well of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (whatcha say, whatcha say)
Wha-wha-wha-wha-what did you say?
Girl, tell me what to say, I
I don’t want you to leave me, though you caught me cheating
Tell me, tell me what to say, I
I really need you in my life 'cause things ain’t right, girl
Girl, tell me what to say, I
