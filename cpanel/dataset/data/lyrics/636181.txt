R, O, C, K, Mafia....

Creation shows me what to do
I'm dancing on the floor with you
And when you touch my hand, 
I go crazy! Yeah!

The music tells me what to feel
Like you now but, is it real
By the time we say: goodnight,
I'll know if this is right

And I feel you coming through my veins
Am I into you or is the music to blame

Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?
Cause' the way your got you body moving,
It's got me confused and, I can't tell
If it's the beat or sparks

Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?
You know I wanna believe, that we're a masterpiece.
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

The room is full but all I see is
The way your eyes just blaze through me
Like fire in the dark, we're like living art!

And it hits me like a tidal wave
Are you feelin' me or is the music to blame!

Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?
Cause' the way your got you body moving,
It's got me confused and, I can't tell
If it's the beat or sparks

Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?
You know I wanna believe, that we're a masterpiece.
But sometimes it's hard to tell in the dark
Who owns my heart?

So come on, baby! 
Keep provoking me! Keep on roping me!
Like a rodeo! Baby, pull me close!
Come one, here we go! Here we go! Here we go!

And it hits me like a tidal wave
Are you feelin' me or is the music to blame

Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?
Cause' the way your got you body moving,
It's got me confused and, I can't tell
If it's the beat or sparks

Who owns my heart? Is it love or is it art?
You now I wanna believe, that we're a masterpiece.
But sometimes it's hard... To tell in the dark!
Who owns my heart?
Who owns my heart?
Who owns my heart?
