Just want us time I should pray
Never thought I gotta go
One more time in this place
So you could see my soul

And is that believe in this
If you try I’ll burn
They’re make believe in me 
Your money is what I own

An you can see this track
That connecting you with gold
In my think that I’ll back
But I just simply growl

You are the crawl in the night
Stepping for your fade down
Just make me feel alive, just upon
‘Cos this a lady is on my knees, 

Wow, I gotta go

When I’m alone on the path
You shiver like a storm
When I’m with you in a flat
Wanna beg me how to fall

Just want chance in the night
Around the world with you 
When I get to the point whats true who was right
You brighter tank the true

Hey, make all a day

You back my pain 
Told about this lie
Learn how to fly 
When I’ll show it to you 
Set the fire
If I know who the true 
You love to fly

Wow I gotta go
Feel the floor
I gotta go
Feel the floor
I gotta go
