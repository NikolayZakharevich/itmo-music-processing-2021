Here i was rollin' in my car
I drove down past the park
Spotted a couple
Who wasn’t trouble
And they were doin' no harm
She leans down and kisses him on his lips
To give her love back he rubs her hips
Oh, i could feel it
I felt their passion
Running through my warming veins
So bad i wished that that was me
Make love like they do on tv
I see, all i seem to see
Is you and me
So bad i wished that that was me
Make love like they do on tv
I see, all i seem to see
Is you and me
How i wished that could be
Baby you and me
To become reality
The perfect love fantasy
If i had one wish it would be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
Now i’m not sayin' something’s wrong with this relationship
But i know one thing, boy
It could be better
We have bedroom secrets
Sealed with a kiss
But nothing compares to this
Talkin' about that real love
That true love
Can you feel me?
Someday it will you and me
Makin' love like they do on tv
I see, all i seem to see
Is you and me
Someday it will you and me
Makin' love like they do on tv
I see, all i seem to see
Is you and me
How i wished that could be
Baby you and me
To become reality
The perfect love fantasy
If i had one wish it would be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In the perfect love fantasy
