In these moments of silence, I see your two sides
Your inner peace, your inner violence
And I'm scared of what I see, 'cause you're just like me
Fallen angels love to sing of their memories
Broken dreams and broken wings
I'm so scared of what I hear, your songs fall out of me like tears

What more can I do?
No one ever sees this side of you
In all your little lies, I know there's truth
And all these foolish things you do
When you ask me to leave, and I fall to my knees
And I'm beggin' you, please

What more can I do?
No one ever sees this side of you
Maybe it's not right, but it's still true
And all the foolish things you do
I'll never stop loving you

In these moments of madness and helplessness
In these hours of darkness and loneliness
I still see the light in you, I still see it shining through

What more can I do?
No one ever sees this side of you
In all your little lies, I know there's truth
And all these foolish things you do
When you ask me to leave, and I fall to my knees
And I'm beggin' you, please

What more can I do?
No one ever sees this side of you
Maybe it's not right, but it's still true
All the foolish things you do
I'll never stop loving you

Is it ever too late? Has it been too long?
To swallow your pride and admit that you were wrong
Is it ever enough?
When you ask me to leave, and I fall to my knees
And I'm beggin' you, please

What more can I do?
No one ever sees this side of you
In all your little lies, I know there's truth
And all these foolish things you do
When you ask me to leave, and I fall to my knees
And I'm beggin' you, please

What more can I do?
No one ever sees this side of you
Maybe it's not right, but it's still true
And all the foolish things you do
I'll never stop loving you

(Never stop, never stop loving)
(Never stop, never stop loving you)
(Never stop, never stop loving)
(Never stop, never stop loving you)
(Never stop, never stop loving)
(Never stop, never stop loving you)
(Never stop, never stop loving)
