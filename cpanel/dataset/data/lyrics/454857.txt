Every time that I look in the mirror,
All these lines on my face getting clearer.
The past that's gone,
In the night like dusk to dawn. (Not sure about that)
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their price in life to pay.

I know nobody knows,
Where it comes and where it goes.
I know everybody sins;
You've got the truth to throw away. (Not sure about that)

Half my life's in books written pages,
Live and learn from fools and from sages.
You know it's true;
All these feelings come back to you.

Sing with me, sing for the year,
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear.
Sing with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away.

Dream on, dream on, dream on,
Dream until your dreams come true.

Every time that you look in the mirror,
All those lines on your face getting clearer.
You know it's true;
All these feelings are coming back to you.

Sing with me, sing for the year,
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear.
Sing with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away.

Dream on, dream on, dream on,
Dream until your dreams come true.
Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on,
Dream on, dream on, dream on, yeah.
