Think what you want about me, about me
Tell me something I don’t know
Tell me something that is real
'Cause I’m tired of hearing all your endless tales
Something’s changed, I don’t know why
Was it me or was it you?
So you’re drawing me right in
Now I have no choice
You tell me, come along
Next thing I know something’s wrong
You tell me, come along
But now we’re undone
I can’t help myself
It’s just all that fear
I can’t help myself
When you are near
I can’t help myself
It’s just all that fear
I can’t help myself
When you are near
I have nothing left to say
Far too many words were said
So I leave you cold
I thought this was for life
You tell me, come along
Next thing I know something’s wrong
You tell me, come along
But now we’re undone
I can’t help myself
It’s just all that fear
I can’t help myself
When you are near
I can’t help myself
It’s just all that fear
I can’t help myself
When you are near
I don’t care
I don’t care
(Remind myself everyday)
I don’t care
(Tell myself when I look in the mirror)
I don’t care
('Cause I can’t live without a heart)
I don’t care
(I don’t, I don’t care)
I don’t care
I don’t care
(I don’t, I don’t care)
