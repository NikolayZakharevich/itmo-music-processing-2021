I sat within the valley green I sat with my true love
My sad heart had to choose between Old Ireland and my love
I looked at her and then I thought how Ireland was torn
While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden corn
T’was hard the woeful words to bring to break the ties that bound
But harder still to bear the shame of English chains around
And so I said, the mountain glen I’ll seek in early morn
And join the brave united men while soft winds shook the corn
While sad I kissed away her tears my fond arms round her clung
A British shot burst in our ears from out of the wild woods round
One bullet pierced my true love’s side a rose pierced by a thorn
And in my arms in blood she died while soft winds shook the corn
So blood for blood without remorse I’ve taken in the glen
I placed my true love’s clayful corpse I joined true Irish men
But around her grave I wander drear sometimes in early morn
And with breaking heart sometimes I hear the wind that shakes the corn
