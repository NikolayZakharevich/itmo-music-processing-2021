A couple of weeks later of my college
I was waiting for my friends when she came to me
We had a good time with her favourite coffee
And I don’t wanna leave that night she wrote to me
But she said now she did a mistake
She said that I can not understand
I thought we made for each other she added
But boy we are different
Boy we are different
Boy we are different
Boy we are different
Soon I came to know she wanna see me
I wanna say her no but I didn’t do it
The same location where we used to meet
She squeezed me tight like I’m her big teddy
But she said now she did a mistake
She said that I can not understand
I thought we made for each other she added
But boy we are different (I'm different you’re different we’re different oh
we’re different)
Boy we are different (I'm different you’re different we’re different yeah we’re
different)
Boy we are different (I'm different you’re different we’re different oh we’re
different)
Boy we are different (I'm different you’re different)
