I’m taking nothing for granted
Open up, just speak to me
We’re not going anywhere like this
So would you rather clench your fist and fight it out?
We’ve failed
It’s just what we deserve
And for these two years of our lives
Not worth discussion, no excuses, not a word
You’ve told me all that I needed
Broken glances make it clear
You’ve made a mess so clear it up
But count me out, I’ve had enough, I’m out of here
We’ve changed
We never had our love
You had a fantasy to live
And for a while I seemed to fit, but time is up
There’s always something better 'round the corner
And you work for it
Now you get your fix
There’s always something better, better
There’s always something better, better
THere’s always something better, better
There’s always something
There’s aways something better
There’s always something better 'round the corner
And you work for it
Now you get your fix
There’s always something better 'round the corner
And you work for it
Now you get your fix
There’s always something better 'round the corner
And you work for it
Now you get your fix
