Woke up this morning with a gun to my head
Somebody help me, she wants me dead
Woke up this morning with the devil in my bed
In the air, everywhere in my maze and in my head

She wants me dead, dead dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, d-dead
She wants me dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, dead, dead, d-dead
She wants me dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
D-d-dead, dead, dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead, d-d
D-d-dead, dead, dead

Dead, dead, dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead

Woke up this morning with a gun to my head
Brotha' should have told me she want me dead
Without a warning, not a clue, without a sound
In your house, out of bounds, but remember you can't hide

She wants me dead, dead dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, d-dead
She wants me dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, dead, dead, d-dead
She wants me dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
D-d-dead, dead, dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead
She wants me dead, d-d-dead, dead, dead, d-d
D-d-d-d, d-d-d-d, dead, dead, dead
