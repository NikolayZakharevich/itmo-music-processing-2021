Man, this fuckin' bitch took off
Fuckin' with some college graduate
Punk ass, Abercrombie wearin' motherfucker
Left me broken hearted in the chevy
It’s all good though, know why?
I got me bitch
Both of us was in the same class
In 02 in Antioch Nash-Ville
I wanted you so bad
That I forgot to mind my manners
Everybody wanted them panties
Every guy was hopin' to land it
We would flirt around and touch hands
Until we fucked around and took Xanax
And that’s when you
Began to drive me bananas
I was in denial, it’s apparent
You began to lie to your parents
You should know that I can’t live
Without you holdin my name
Now my hearts in control of my brain
And I can’t hold it in the lanes
Rollin' down 20 main
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck
And I’m doin' 120 main
Maybe I’m givin' up, baby, I’m givin' up
Baby, what is happenin'?
Don’t you believe in us, don’t you believe in us?
She said, «I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough, love is not enough
Love is not enough»
Used to fuck so much we missed school
You was there when I needed you
I was there when you needed me
We were unseparable
When I was broke with no fuckin' food
You was tough enough to be cool
Skate holes all in my shoes
Dope boys had me confused
I was in love with hip hop
You was in love with that too
What made it come to a stop
Had to have been the money issue
Bitch, and I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul
And all I got left is a key chain
Rollin' down 20 main
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck
And I’m doin' 120 main
Maybe I’m givin' up, baby, I’m givin' up
Baby, what is happenin'?
Don’t you believe in us, don’t you believe in us?
She said, «I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough, love is not enough
Love is not enough»
Who the fuck are you fuckin' now?
Bet he’s always taken you out
College educated and proud
Me, well, I’m just a drop out
Can’t really blame you for buggin'
Ain’t I the dirt on your rug and
Just a place to wipe your shoes and
Give me all your throw away lovin'
Back to my buzzin' and druggin'
Back to my gutter with nothin'
Back to the rut all the sudden
Cracks in the covenant trustin' me
You ain’t gotta worry 'bout
Sharin' this success with Wayne
And that was just petty change
But I still feel the pain
Rollin' down 20 main
With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck
And I’m doin' 120 main
Maybe I’m givin' up, baby, I’m givin' up
Baby, what is happenin'?
Don’t you believe in us, don’t you believe in us?
She said, «I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough, love is not enough
Love is not enough»
