All you sea barren men, you’re bound to sail again
Far away from your mooring down in Portsmouth
With your mast strung high and wavin' goodbye
To the lassies you left on shore
I’ve a fine strong crew and I tell 'em what to do
I’m the captain of the ship The Bonny Lady
She my joy and my pride and she’s twenty meters wide
And I call her the ship The Bonny Lady
So haul down the riggin' for we’re bound to sail away
Across the ragin' ocean and we’re sailin' out today
And if we do return you’re bound to hear us say
We’ll be going to sea once more
I’ve a fine strong crew and I tell 'em what to do
I’m the captain of the ship The Bonny Lady
She my joy and my pride and she’s twenty meters wide
And I call her the ship The Bonny Lady
Well my shipmates and me, we sail from sea to sea
With the wind a-whistlin' through the sails
Though the crew gets no rest, they think that I’m the best
Cause I bailed them one and all out of jail
I’ve a fine strong crew and I tell 'em what to do
I’m the captain of the ship The Bonny Lady
She my joy and my pride and she’s twenty meters wide
And I call her the ship The Bonny Lady
We’ve a vast haul of rum, a cargo we will run
From along the far off shores of Haiti
With the brisk salt air just blowin' through me hair
At the wheel of the ship The Bonny Lady
I’ve a fine strong crew and I tell 'em what to do
I’m the captain of the ship The Bonny Lady
She my joy and my pride and she’s twenty meters wide
And I call her the ship The Bonny Lady
I’ve a fine strong crew and I tell 'em what to do
I’m the captain of the ship The Bonny Lady
She my joy and my pride and she’s twenty meters wide
And I call her the ship The Bonny Lady
