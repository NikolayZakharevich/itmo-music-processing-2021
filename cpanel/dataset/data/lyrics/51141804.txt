Tonight is long enough for us to dream twice
But I ain't catching no Z's, sing while I swing dice
There is a bet in every minute
This is what I sound like winning...

This is the Road between me and myself
Driving blindfolded down the highway of my hell
Standing on my own two, and I know my shit stank
Part of me everywhere, everywhere the kid paints

Hear me like a mural that be calling out your nickname
Never had no reason, like we grown in the first place
Even though I'm still blind, I can just feel mine
The ladder gone grow and I'm tired, but I still climb

Poet and a prisoner, watch us both feel time
Hear the hollow in my headphones wake me up
Start the search for mine, and a sky that will pick me up
My name's Fire, I am a friend of Dust

I am tying all the ends that touch
Now get down with it
You and I are same, but I belong here
Sense's turn to sleep, now I'm lost in the chair

And I don't want to search, I just want to find
And I don't want to work, I should've chose the life of crime
Villain on his own grind, living in a goldmine
Damn, this a good world, studio is all mine

Now, I see where I sit is the throne
From the shit from up which we've grown
I am built for the worth we're owed
To the dirt where the earthly go

Ain't no earthly soul
Now, I see where I sit is the throne
From the shit from up which we've grown
I am built for the worth we're owed

To the dirt where the earthly go
Ain't no earthly soul
Or maybe I'm tripping, I don't really know
Maybe I'm slipping, blood up in my bones

The marrow of my mission, not bundles of dough
But breaking out of prison, this prison of my own
This is the Road between me and myself
Streets indigo with a glow that will make your eyes melt
