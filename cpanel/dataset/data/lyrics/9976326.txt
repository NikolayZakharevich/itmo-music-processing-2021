I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one night
Woke me up right after 2
Stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn't lose my mind

And I had the week that came from hell
And yes I know that you could tell
But you're like the net under the ledge
Whether I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

And if you only die once
I wanna die with

You got something I need
In this world full of people,
There's one killing me
And if we only die once,
I wanna die with you

You got something I need
In this world full of people,
There's one killing me
And if we only die once,
I wanna die with you

Last night I think I drank too much, yeah
Call it our temporary crunch
With broken words I've tried to say
Honey don't you be afraid
If we got nothing, we got us, yeah

And if you only die once
I wanna die with

You got something I need
In this world full of people,
There's one killing me
And if we only die once,
I wanna die with you

You got something I need
In this world full of people,
There's one killing me
And if we only die once,
I wanna die with you

I know that we're not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it
To this time, this time, around, yeah

You got something I need
In this world full of people,
There's one killing me
And if we only die once,
I wanna die with you

You got something I need
In this world full of people,
There's one killing me
And if we only live once,
I wanna live with you
