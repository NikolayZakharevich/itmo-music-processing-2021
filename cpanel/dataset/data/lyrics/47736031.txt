Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy
Easy, easy
You switch the screens over the
Rest of you fools
Easy, oh easy
They poke around until they
Get what they want
Easy, oh easy
Oh, easy, easy
Throw the lunch you pay for
Out of sight when it’s
Easy, oh easy
Throw the lunch you pay for
Oh easy, easy
Easy, easy
Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy
