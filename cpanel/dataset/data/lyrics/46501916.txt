Have you heard the news today?
Just like a fix she’s floating through his vains
Have you heard the news today?
Like a tumor she spread to his brain
Living isn’t easy
She’s gonna mess this up completely and no one can hold you down
We can build a spaceship and fly away
And we can start all over somewhere else
We can build a spaceship, come with me
And we can start all over, close your eyes and follow me
We can build a spaceship and fly away
And we can start all over somewhere else
We can build a spaceship, come with me
And if Earth is calling, close your eyes and let it be
So have you heard the news today?
If you listen close you’ll hear his heart break
'Cause in the psycho world of Eden
This is the version where she is the snake
Living isn’t easy
She messed things up completely and no one can hold you down
We can build a spaceship and fly away
And we can start all over somewhere else
We can build a spaceship, come with me
And we can start all over, close your eyes and follow me
We can build a spaceship and fly away
And we can start all over somewhere else
We can build a spaceship, come with me
And if Earth is calling, close your eyes and let it be
Things are gone, family too
He turned his back on everything he knew
He dug for gold and found a grave
He asked for freedom and became a slave
And she keeps haunting him and no one can hold you down
We can build a spaceship and fly away
And we can start all over somewhere else
We can build a spaceship, come with me
And we can start all over, close your eyes and follow me
We can build a spaceship and fly away
And we can start all over somewhere else
We can build a spaceship, come with me
And if Earth is calling, close your eyes and let it be
