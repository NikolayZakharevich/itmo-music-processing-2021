I feel the shadows hanging over
They're waiting to come closer
To come and take me away
And I can feel my heart skip
Everytime that I sleep
I wanna run away

I, I've been working the morning
Don't get off til the night
I can't find the time to clear my mind
Oh, I dream of the lazy days
One of the careless ways for me to be living

I feel the shadows hanging over
They're waiting to come closer
To come and take me away
And I can feel my heart skip
Everytime that I sleep
I wanna run away

I feel the shadows hanging over
They're waiting to come closer
To come and take me away
And I can feel my heart skip
Everytime that I sleep
I wanna run away
