Cheer
They been waiting for me
Hahahaha...
What the fuck? (The fuck?)

Feel the morning on my face
Ain't a pill that I didn't take
Just a lifetime 'cause it's been a long day
'Cause I'ma sleep when I R.I.P, bada-badum

Flashbacks, relapses
Camera flash, and don't forget your hashtag
Rucksack, white stacks
You're a dead man, you better rid of that gat
You gonna run game, it don't ever run you, uh
When they bitchin' on your name, you say "Fuck you too, too"
You say fuck a court case, give detective no clues, clues
'Cause I'm Indiana J when I'm trippin' on the juice
Now let's get real quiet

Feel so, feel so stupid
Ooh...
Yeah-yeah, talk to me

'Bout to make a big deal, uproar
And I'm in for the kill, La Roux
Bitches looking like a meal, contour
Percoceting till we can't feel no more
And I smoked something that gon' knock me out, out
Somehow this body just won't stay down, down
Now let's get real quiet

Feel the morning on my face
Ain't a pill that I didn't take (bada-badum)
Just a lifetime 'cause it's been a long day (bada-badum)
'Cause I'ma sleep when I R.I.P, bada-badum
