I’ve got nothing to hide
I’ve got nothing at all
You with all of the answers
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
Talking, talking it hurts
I just wanted disert
Or a better disaster
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
Running away, running away
Running away, running away
Go!
Go!
I don’t wanna be fake
But is fill up the room
Sick of be in your alter
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
Shut up, shut up it burns
Spit on me with your words
All this static is poison
Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
Running away, running away
Running away, running away
Go!
Go!
Nobody’s ever gonna tie me down
Nobody’s ever gonna hurt me now
Go!
Running away, running away
Go!
Running away, running away
Go!
Running away, running away
Go
