Where are we?
what the hell is going on?
the dust has only
just begun to fall
Crop circles in the carpet
Sinking feeling

Spin me round again
and rub my eyes
this can't be happening
when busy streets a mess with people
would stop to hold their heads heavy

Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
All those years
They were here first

oily marks appear on walls
where pleasure moments hung before
the takeover
the sweeping insensitivity
of this
still life

Hide and seek
trains and sewing machines (you won't catch me around here)
Blood and tears
They were here first

mm what d'cha say?
mm that you only meant well, well of course you did
mm what d'cha say?
mm that it's all for the best, of course it is
mm what d'cha say?
hmmm that it's just what we need, you decided this?
ooh what d'cha say?
mmmm what did she say?

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid sweet talk newspaper word cut outs (echo:paper word cut outs)
Speak no feeling no I don't believe you (echo: I don't believe you)
you don't care a bit
you don't care a bit

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid sweet talk newspaper word cut outs
Have no feeling no I don't believe you
you don't care a bit
you don't care a bit

Hide and Seek

Oh no, You don't care a bit
Oh no, You don't care a bit
Oh no, You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit
You don't care a bit
