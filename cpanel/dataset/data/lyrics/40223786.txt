You were born in '67
About 9 o'clock at night

A couple years before I lost control
Аnd ended up inside.

The clouds in
Camarillo 
Shimmer with a light that's
So unreal
Now I fear the stories
That they told me 
Of how I hurt my baby
Must be somehow true

I stopped taking all my pills
they made me feel so dead inside.

Just like the sun was going out
I didn't think I сould survive

The clouds in
Camarillo 
Shimmer with a light that's
So unreal 
Now I fear the stories
That they told me 
Of how I hurt my baby
Must be somehow true

Now I'm writing from a caravan
behind your nana's place

I think my spirit will be happier
with the stars in outer space.

The clouds in
Camarillo 
Shimmer with a light that's
So unreal
Now I fear the stories
That they told me 
Of how I hurt my baby
Must be somehow true

The clouds in
Camarillo 
Shimmer with a light that's
So unreal
Now I fear the stories
That they told me 
Of how I hurt my baby
Must be somehow true

The clouds in
Camarillo 
Shimmer with a light that's
So unreal
Now I fear the stories
That they told me 
Of how I hurt my baby
Must be somehow true
