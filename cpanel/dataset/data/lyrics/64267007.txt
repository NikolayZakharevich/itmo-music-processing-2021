Uh

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
Just when I thought she was mine, he caught her by the mouth
I waited eight long months, he finally set her free
I told her I couldn't lie, she was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
He's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I've got her where I want her now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
Cause I've got her where I want her now
And if you could, then you know you would
Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more
I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, that we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry homie, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they wanted
It's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I've got her where I want her now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
And steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
Cause I've got her where I want her right now
And if you could, then you know you would
Cause God, it just feels so

It just feels so good

I watched her wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving
You, you

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got her where I want her now

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I've got her where I want her now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
And steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
Cause I got her where I want her now
And if you could, then you know you would
Cause God, it just feels so
Just feels so good
