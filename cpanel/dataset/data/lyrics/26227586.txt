Well, they say people come, say people go
This particular diamond is extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you're celestial

Like a lion you ran, goddess you rode
Like an eagle, you circle, and perfect of all
So how come things move on? How come cars don’t slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should, but I can’t, let you go

But when I’m cold, cold
When I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
It’s a feeling within me, everglow

But my brothers in blood, sisters you write
And we swore on that night we’d be friends 'til we die
With the changing of winds and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And oh, I’m gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
You alone are the sun
And I know that you’re with me, in a way it'll show
And you’re with me wherever I go
But you give me this feeling, this everglow

Oh, what I would give for just a moment of hope
Yeah, I live for this feeling, it’s everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
