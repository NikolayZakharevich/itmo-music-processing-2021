I find that I am shaking
From my head down to my feet
My hands are sweating so bad
And I can barely speak
Read between the lines here
Dunno what to think
It's a guessing game…

Was it the face?
Was it the moves?
Was it the way that she just knew me?
Was it the meaning behind every smile
I Try to walk, but can't leave
Her eyes, they pierce right through me
But I don't care
As long as I am here

I can't move cos I'm under her spell
Can't breath, as a side-effect from this
And I know that this will be, the ends of me…
I can't move cos I'm under her spell
Can't breath, as a side-effect from this
And I don't care
As long as I am here

My head's a mess
But at the time clearer
And I'm feeling so content
But unsure
Reaching out, reaching in
Wish I knew what you were dreaming
And I never want to ever let this go

Yeah…

I can't move cos I'm under her spell
Can't breath, as a side-effect from this
And I know that this will be, the ends of me…
I can't move cos I'm under her spell
Can't breath, as a side-effect from this
And I don't care
As long as I am here
