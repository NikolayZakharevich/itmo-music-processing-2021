Tumble out of bed
Dizzy in the head
Saying what you said
When you came home alone

Mumble a reply
Followed by a lie
You've been wondering why
As if I've never known

Partial to the groove
But still you never move
Stubborn through and through
You're just an animal

Stuck inside your clutch
It's chilling to the touch
Never liked it much
And now you won't let go
(Let go...)
(Back it... down)

Admit that I was right
But still you try to fight
You leave me in the night
When you refuse to lose

Step out of the car
Head into the bar
It's nothing new as far
As you're concerned

Wonder who to blame
Your father was the same
Always playing games
And never backing down

You stare at her face
Wondering how to phrase
Your invitation home
You're just a little boy

Tumble out of bed
Dizzy in the head
Saying what you said
When you came home alone

Mumble a reply
Followed by a lie
You've been wondering why
As if I've never known

Partial to the groove
But still you never move
Stubborn through and through
You're just an animal

Stuck inside your clutch
It's chilling to the touch
Never liked it much
And now you won't let go
(Let go...)
(Back it... down)
(Let go...)
