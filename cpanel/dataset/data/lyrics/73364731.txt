She is ain’t no angel
Who lives on the hills
Her deal with the devil is paying her bills
She’s sleeping with strangers and staying up on pills
Her mom has to tell her get up on the front
Dreaming about diamonds and rings
Wearing the crown of a king
She should have known drinks are a dangerous thing
And money is everything, everything, everything
She’s coming for you, coming for me
She’s nothing but trouble
She’s walking like me, talking like me
She’s
Coming for you, coming for me
She’s nothing but trouble
She’s talking to spiders
Feeding her snakes
Act like a soulmate but I feel the taint
There’s something about her
Back on my throne, dreaming about diamonds and rings
She’s wearing the crown of a king
Drinks are a dangerous thing
And money is everything, everything
Shes coming for you, coming for me
She’s nothing but trouble
Shes walking like me, talking like me
Coming for you, coming for me
She’s nothing but trouble
Nothing but trouble
Nothing but trouble
And I just love it when she lies
I see the child in her eyes
It could be Paradise
I guess well found out when she dies
Shes coming for you, coming for me
She’s nothing but trouble
Shes walking like me, talking like me
Coming for you, coming for me
She’s nothing but trouble
