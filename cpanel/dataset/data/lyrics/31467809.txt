First they tell you that they love you
Then they ask where you coming from
Like you the only one feeling how you feeling
Then you lie just to make it sound appealing
To him and her and even the family
That you keep close, just to blow the steam like Stanley
You the one that have to plunge in the back
Praying people in the front don't figure where you at
I get that, used to pray for the feeling, I don't miss that
I was stuck for a while, I'll admit it
The same damn thing, that you feeling man I get it but
I'm past that now, I sip this crown I don't mix no sprite
Only sip brown when I'm cooling with my niggas
So bitch go figure, its that kind of night, alright?

I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I fuck you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
Well fuck you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help

Maybe if I had some diamond rings and nicer things
And wider cream, and smaller dreams, the simple things
That would have brought money more quickly
Maybe then you'd get the picture
But even then still snapping for my niggas
Swear I'm always on the phone tryna make sense of figures
Cause the nigga that got it ain't never been the one to spend it
You get it? Neither do I
The thought suicide for the money
We just call it being hungry nowadays
Every nigga getting paid, just a couple getting laid
If the chips fall right and the dick alright
Can I stay all night?
I can lie pretty well
Cause you posting all of my songs
Knowing pussy gonna sell

I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I fuck you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
Well fuck you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help
I love you
The things that cross my mind while I'm by myself
I hate you
These things go through my mind while I'm by myself
I fuck you
These things run through my mind while I'm by myself
Well fuck you
It's always on my mind, think I need some help
