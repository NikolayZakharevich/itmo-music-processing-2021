Don't care how long we go
I'm be home in a day
Yah good times three men
Playing pool one day
But someday baby
You ain't gonna trouble
For me.... anymore
Goodbye girl better get gone
Skit
Gone
Had a great time
Got beat pretty good
Had a good thing going
Got more than you gave
Goddamn but now I'll give it to you
Girl, you got game
Just keep on betting
Any day it's gonna pay yah
Hold on darling you're leaving to fast
But someday baby
You ain't gonna trouble
For me.... anymore
Goodbye girl better get gone
Skit
Gone
Had a great time
Got beat pretty good
Had a good thing going
Got more than you gave
Goddamn but now I'll give it to you
Girl, you got game
Yeah goodbye baby
Better close that door
Once you've found love
You can't stay long
But someday baby
You ain't gonna trouble
For me.... anymore
But someday baby
You ain't gonna trouble
For me.... anymore
Goodbye girl better get gone
Skit
Gone
Had a great time
Got beat pretty good
Had a good thing going
Got more than you gave
Goddamn but now I'll give it to you
Girl, you got game
