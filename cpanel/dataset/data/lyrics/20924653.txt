Between the here, between the now
Between the north, between the south
Between the west, between the east
Between the time, between the place

From the shell
A song of the sea
Neither quiet nor calm
Searching for love again
Mo ghrá (My love)

Between the winds, between the waves
Between the sands, between the shore

From the shell
A song of the sea
Neither quiet nor calm
Searching for love again

Between the stones, between the storm
Between belief, between the sea
Tá mé i dtiúin (I am in tune)
