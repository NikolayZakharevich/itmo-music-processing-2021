Yeah yeah, ah
I hope your lips don't lie

You're the fighter, I'm the fire
Make you fall in love in a minute
You're a leaver, I believe you
Tell me that you don't do commitment

You say it's not real
But it's sure pretty close
Don't know how you'll feel
But baby I know you know how it's supposed to be

One hit (one hit), you're mine (you're mine)
I can tell your lips don't lie
When you kiss it right back (right back), oh my (uh)
I can tell your lips don't lie

Lips don't la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
(Lips don't) la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
I can tell your lips don't lie

You're quick (you're quick), I do it slow (so slow)
But then I let you drive past the limit
It's difficult, I know (I know)
But I'll make you come fast in a minute

Met you at 12, danced until 1
Got at least 2, but we're not drunk
So I know it's real (I know it's real)
And baby I know you know how it's supposed to be

One hit (one hit), you're mine (you're mine)
I can tell your lips don't lie
When you kiss it right back (right back), oh my (uh)
I can tell your lips don't lie

Lips don't la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie (Lips don't lie)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie (Boy your lips don't)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie (Boy your lips don't)
I can tell your lips don't lie
(Boy your lips don't lie)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie
I can tell your lips don't lie

I treated you like a friend so you felt comfortable
I treated you like a ten and now I'm a dog to you
Told me your secrets, your secrets, show me your 
I wanna make your business my business, don't tell me lies though
And it's fucked up when you found me my heart was so cold
I was up, left you down just like a yo-yo
I was fucking around, hard to control though
Oh yeah, mmh, I left you solo

One hit (one hit), you're mine (you're mine)
I can tell your lips don't lie
When you kiss it right back babe (right back), oh my (uh)
I can tell your lips don't lie

Lips don't la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie (Boy your lips don't lie)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie (Boy your lips don't)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie (Boy your lips don't)
I can tell your lips don't lie
(Boy your lips don't lie)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie-lie
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-lie-lie (No no no no no)
I can tell your lips don't lie
