Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth

I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you in Hell

Don't try to be a baby
Your future's in an oblong box, yeah
Don't try to be a baby
Should have seen it a-comin' on
Don't try to be a baby
I don't know it was in your power
Don't try to be a baby
Dead-end girl for a dead-end guy
Don't try to be a baby
Now your life drains on the floor
Don't try to be a baby

Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth

I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you in Hell

Don't try to be a baby
Your future is in an oblong box
Don't try to be a baby
Should have seen the end a-comin' on, a-comin'
Don't try to be a baby
I don't know it was in your power
Don't try to be a baby
Dead-end girl for a dead-end guy
Don't try to be a baby
Now your life drains on the floor
Don't try to be a baby

Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Shut your pretty mouth

I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you in Hell

Don't try to be a baby
Die, die, die my darling
Don't try to be a baby
Die, die, die my darling
Die, die, die my darling
Die, die, die my darling

Die, die, die, die, die, die....
