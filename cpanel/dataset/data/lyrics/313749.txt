The journey home is never too long
Your heart arrives before the train
The journey home is never too long
Some yesterdays always remain
I’m going back to where my heart was light
When my pillow was a ship, I sailed through the night
Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah…
The journey home is never too long
When open hearts are waiting there
The journey home is never too long
There’s room to love and room to spare
I want to feel the way that I did then
And think my wishes through before I wish again
Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah…
Not every boat you come across is one you have to take
No, sometimes standing still can be the best move you ever make
The journey home is never too long
Comes helps to heal the deepest pain
The journey home is never too long
Your heart arrives before the train
