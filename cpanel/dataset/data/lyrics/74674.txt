I need some sleep, you can't go on like this
I tried counting sheep but there's one I always miss

Everyone says, "I'm getting down too low"
Everyone says, "You just gotta let it go"
You just gotta let it go, you just gotta let it go

I need some sleep, time to put the old horse down
I'm in too deep and the wheels keep spinning round

Everyone says, "I'm getting down too low"
Everyone says, "You just gotta let it go"
You just gotta let it go, you just gotta let it go

You just gotta let it go, you just gotta let it go
Just gotta let it go
