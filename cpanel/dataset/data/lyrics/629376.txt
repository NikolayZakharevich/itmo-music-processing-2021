And I wanna believe you
When you tell me that it’ll be ok
Ya I try to believe you
But I don’t
When you say that it’s gonna be
It always turns out to be a different way
I try to believe you
Not today, today, today, today, today
I don’t know how I’ll feel
Tomorrow, tomorrow
I don’t know what to say
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Is a different day
It’s always been up to you
It’s turning around
It’s up to me
I’m gonna do what I have to do
Just don’t
Gimme a little time
Leave me alone a little while
Maybe it’s not too late
Not today, today, today, today, today
I don’t know how I’ll feel
Tomorrow, tomorrow
I don’t know what to say
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Is a different day
Hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
And I know I’m not ready
Hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah, maybe tomorrow
Hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
And I know I’m not ready
Hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah, maybe tomorrow
And I wanna believe you
When you tell me that it’ll be ok
Yeah I try to believe you
Not today, today, today, today, today
