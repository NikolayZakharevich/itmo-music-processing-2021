As home, I’m not afraid, no
The fear in my eyes, it steers you, see?
Control, but I’m not his slave, no
Start your war 'cause I’m running free
I better run, run
(Running, running)
Faster than the bullet from a gun, gun
(Running, running, running, running)
Run before he pulls it down, it’s done, done
(Running, running, running, running)
Shouldn’t live in fear 'cause I’m having fun, done
(Running, running, running, running, running, running)
Let’s go, we’re not in a safe, so
No time to stop, no time to sleep
Oh no, he can’t have my soul
It’s mine alone, and it stays with me
I think I better run, run
(Running, running)
Faster than the bullet from a gun, gun
(Running, running, running, running)
Run before he pulls it down, it’s done, done
(Running, running, running, running)
Shouldn’t live in fear 'cause I’m having fun
(Running, running, running, running, running, running)
I better run, run
(Running, running)
Faster than the bullet from a gun, gun
(Running, running, running, running)
Run before he pulls it down, it’s done, done
(Running, running, running, running)
Shouldn’t live in fear 'cause I’m having fun, done
(Running, running, running, running, running, running)
Fear, fear, fear, fear
I think I better run, run
(Running, running)
Faster than the bullet from a gun, gun
(Running, running, running, running)
Run before he pulls it down, it’s done, done
(Running, running, running, running)
Shouldn’t live in fear 'cause I’m having fun
(Running, running, running, running, running, running)
I better run, run
(Running, running)
Faster than the bullet from a gun, gun
(Running, running, running, running)
Run before he pulls it down, it’s done, done
(Running, running, running, running)
Shouldn’t live in fear 'cause I’m having fun, done
(Running, running, running, running, running, running)
I should live in fear 'cause I’m having fun, done
