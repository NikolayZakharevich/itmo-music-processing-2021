I'm just a step away, I'm just a breath away.
Losin' my faith today (I'm falling off the edge today).
I am just a man, not superhuman (I'm not superhuman).
Someone save me from the haze.

Just another war, just another family torn.
(I'm falling from my faith today).
Just a step from the edge, just another day in the world we live.

I need a Hero to save me now.
I need a Hero to save me now.
I need a Hero to save my life.
A Hero will save me just in time.

I've got to fight today to live another day
Speaking my mind today (My voice will be heard today).
I've got to make a stand, but I am just a man (I'm not superhuman).
My voice will be heard today

It's just another war, just another family torn (My voice will be heard today)
It's just another kill, the countdown begins to destroy ourselves.

I need a Hero to save me now.
I need a Hero to save me now.
I need a Hero to save my life.
A Hero will save me just in time.

I need a Hero to save my life.
I need a Hero just in time.
Save me just in time.
Save me just in time.

Who's going to fight for what's right?
Who's going to help us survive?
We're in the fight of our lives
(And we're not ready to die).

Who's going to fight for the weak?
Who's going to make them believe?
I've got a Hero living in me!

Who's going to fight for what's right?
Today I'm speaking my mind.
And if it kills me tonight, I will be ready to die.

A Hero's not afraid to give His life.
A Hero's going to save me just in time...

I need a Hero to save me now.
I need a Hero to save me now.
I need a Hero to save my life.
A Hero will save me just in time.

I need a Hero...

Who's going to fight for what's right?
Who's going to help us survive?

I need a Hero...

Who's going to fight for the weak?
Who's going to make them believe?

I need a Hero.
I need a Hero.

A Hero's going to save me just in time...
