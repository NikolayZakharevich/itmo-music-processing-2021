Come on come on
Shed the skin that’s held you in
Ya, held you far too long
Now how bad could it be
If you should fall in love with me
How bad could it be
Sexuality
Come on come on
Kiss away the ones who say
The lust you feel is wrong
Now how bad could it be
If you amuse yourself with me
How bad could it be
Sexuality
Release yourself upon me
Free the hounds of chastity
Unleash your sexuality on me
How bad could it be
If you should lose yourself in me
Now how bad could it be
Sexuality
Release yourself upon me
Free the hounds of chastity
Unleash your sexuality on me
