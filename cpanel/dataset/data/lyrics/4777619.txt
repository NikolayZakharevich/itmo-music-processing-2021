Thought it was over but its only just begun
Got our heads in a spin once again
Thought they were gone but it’s turns out we were wrong
They don’t know that were planning our revenge
Trying to hide but got caught in our tracks
Its not easy when your losing your mind
With the dark eagle eyes they are watching all the time
Till they lock us up and put out our lights
You’ll spend a long time running
Next time around we will put you in your place
Your gonna get whats coming
Best be watching your back everyday
For eternity!
This is our nightmare being knocked out again
Feeling weak it ain’t fair, so to speak
Just keep on trying to put up a fight
But you’ll land in a pile of defeat
Its all the truth we explained in that room
But no one would ever believe
If you separate all of the truth from the lies
Then it turns out they all could be right
You’ll spend a long time running
Next time around we will put you in your place
Your gonna get whats coming
Best be watching your back everyday
For eternity!
Been running, still running
Your gonna get whats coming
Been running, still running now
You’ll spend a long time running
Next time around we will put you in your place
Your gonna get whats coming
Best be watching your back everyday
You’ll spend a long time running
Next time around we will put you in your place
Your gonna get whats coming
Best be watching your back everyday
For eternity!
