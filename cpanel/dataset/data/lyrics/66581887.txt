Seems you've been changing lately
I can feel the distance in your touch
There's two people in this hallway
But there's only one of us
That's tryna keep this fire going
Should I just give up?
I sense trouble on the horizon
I'm afraid our time is up

The clouds are rolling in, I feel you drifting away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain
I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

Yeah, I can taste it, it's the end
This love's impossible to save
Though you embrace it, I can't face it
So I look the other way
There's trouble in your eyes
But I pretend that we're okay
I wish that we could compromise
But there's just nothing left to say

The clouds are rolling in, I feel you drifting away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain
I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain

Trying to light a match in the rain
Like flying a kite in a hurricane
Like riding a bike with no air or chain
On a broken road, it's a losing game
Trying to light a match in the rain
Like flying a kite in a hurricane
Like riding a bike with no air or chain
On a broken road, it's a losing game

The clouds are rolling in, I feel you drifting away
And though my intuition tells me that it's too late
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain
I still want to make you love me, make you love me again
Even though my intuition tells me that it's the end
That in these conditions tryna bring back the flame is like
Tryna light a match in the rain
