6-SUSAN STAYS HOME AND BAKES COOKIES
Susan decides to cheer up her husband. Bob loves her homemade cookies.
Nicole suggests she start a cookie business
Susan: Bob, I baked cookies for you
Bob: That was so nice of you, dear. You’ve got a heart of gold!
Susan: Go ahead and pig out!
Bob: These are delicious!
Susan: I thought they might cheer you up. You’ve been in a bad mood lately
Bob: I guess I have been a little on edge. But these cookies are just what the
doctor ordered!
Nicole: Do I smell cookies?
Susan: Yes, Nicole. Help yourself
Nicole: Yum-yum.* These are out of this world. You could go into business
selling these!
Bob: You could call them Susan’s Scrumptious Cookies. You’d make a bundle
Susan: Good thinking!
Nicole: Don’t forget to give me credit for the idea after you’re rich and
famous!
Susan: You know I always give credit where credit is due!
