N- n- now th- that don't kill me 
Can only make me stronger 
I need you to hurry up now 
Cause I can't wait much longer 
I know I got to be right now 
Cause I can’t get much wronger 
Man I’ve been waitin' all night now 
That's how long I’ve been on ya 

I need you right now 
I need you right now 

Lets get lost tonight 
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight 
Play secretary 
I’m the boss tonight 
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right? 
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior 
Damn they don't make 'em like this anymore 
I ask, cause I’m not sure 
Do anybody make real shit anymore? 
Bow in the presence of greatness 
Cause right now thou has forsaken us 
You should be honored by my lateness 
That I would even show up to 
This fake shit 
So go ahead go nuts go ape sh*t 
'Specially in my Pastel, 
On my Bape shit 
Act like you can't tell who made this 
New gospel homey take six, 
And take this, haters 

N- n- now th- that don't kill me 
Can only make me stronger 
I need you to hurry up now 
Cause I can't wait much longer 
I know I got to be right now 
Cause I can’t get much wronger 
Man I’ve been waitin' all night now 
That's how long I’ve been on ya 

I need you right now 
I need you right now 

I don't know if you got a man or not, 
If you made plans or not 
God put me in the plans or not 
I'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot 
But I know that god put you in front of me 
So how the hell could you front on me 
There's a thousand yous there's only one of me 
I'm trippin' I’m caught up in the moment right? 
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night 
So we gon' do everything that Kan' like 
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike 
Well I’d do anything for a blonde-dike 
And she'll do anything 
For the limelight 
And we'll do anything 
When the time's right 
Ugh, baby you're makin' it harder, better, faster, stronger 

N- n- now th- that don't kill me 
Can only make me stronger 
I need you to hurry up now 
Cause I can't wait much longer 
I know I got to be right now 
Cause I can’t get much wronger 
Man I’ve been waitin all night now 
That's how long I’ve been on ya 

I need you right now

Since OJ had isotoners 
Don't act like I never told ya
