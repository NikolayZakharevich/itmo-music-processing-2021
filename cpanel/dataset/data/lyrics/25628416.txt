I might never be
Your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one
You take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious (Oh, yeah)
Girl, I hope you’re sure. What you’re looking for
‘Cause I’m not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things
You know that we shouldn’t do
Baby, I’m perfect
Baby, I’m perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving
With the windows down
And if you like going places
We can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you’ve been dreaming about
Baby, you’re perfect
Baby, you’re perfect
So let’s start right now

I might never be the hand you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you
Any time you want them
But that don’t mean that we
Can’t live here in the moment
‘Cause I can be the one
You love from time to time

When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious
Girl, I hope you’re sure. What you’re looking for
‘Cause I’m not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things
You know that we shouldn’t do
Baby, I’m perfect
Baby, I’m perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving
With the windows down
And if you like going places
We can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you’ve been dreaming about
Baby, you’re perfect
Baby, you’re perfect
So let’s start right now

And if you like cameras flashing
Every time we go out (Oh, yeah)
And if you’re looking for someone
To write your breakup songs about
Baby, I’m perfect
Baby, we’re perfect

If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things
You know that we shouldn’t do
Baby, I’m perfect
Baby, I’m perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving
With the windows down
And if you like going places
We can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you’ve been dreaming about
Baby, you’re perfect
Baby, you’re perfect
So let’s start right now
