As I was ridin' over the far famed Kerry Mountains
I met with Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol and then I drew my sabre
Said «Stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver»
Musha ringum durm’da
Whack fol the daddy-o
Whack fol the daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She said and she swore that she never would betray me
The devil take the women for they never can be easy
Musha ringum durm’da
Whack fol the daddy-o
Whack fol the daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar
I went up to my chamber all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels, boys, and sure it was no wonder
But Jenny took my charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for Captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
Musha ringum durm’da
Whack fol the daddy-o
Whack fol the daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar
Next day just as I was leavin', was early in the mornin'
The captain and his soldiers came at me without warnin'
I then produced my pistol, she stole away my sabre
I couldn’t shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken
Musha ringum durm’da
Whack fol the daddy-o
Whack fol the daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar
I’d like to find my brother, he’s the one that’s in the army
I don’t know where he’s stationed, is it Cork or in Killarney?
Together we’ll go ridin' o’er the mountains of Kilkenny
Oh, I know he’ll treat me better than my darlin' sportin' Jenny
Musha ringum durm’da
Whack fol the daddy-o
Whack fol the daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar
Musha ringum durm’da
Whack fol the daddy-o
Whack fol the daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar
There’s some delight in fishin' and some delight in bowlin'
And some take delight in their carriages a-rollin'
But I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courtin' pretty girls in the mornin' bright and early
Musha ringum durm’da
Whack fol the daddy-o
Whack fol the daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar
Musha ringum durm’da
Whack fol the daddy-o
Whack fol the daddy-o
There’s whiskey in the jar
