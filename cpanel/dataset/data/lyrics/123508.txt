Double, double toil and trouble
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble
Double, double toil and trouble
Something wicked this way comes

Eye of newt, and toe of frog
Wool of bat, and tongue of dog
Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting
Lizard's leg, and owlet's wing

Double, double toil and trouble
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble
Double, double toil and trouble
Something wicked this way comes

In the cauldron boil and bake
Fillet of a fenny snake
Scale of dragon; tooth of wolf
Witches' mummy; maw and gulf

Double, double toil and trouble
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble
Double, double toil and trouble
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble

Double, double toil and trouble
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble

Something wicked this way comes
