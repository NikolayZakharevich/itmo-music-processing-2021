Must’ve seen the warning
Some gold from the king
The Navy grants a bounty
The scums are chasing me 
I drink with the boozers
Howling all the night
When comes my Rosie
She’s gotta be around
At dawn I am to leave

Hold again
For the last sea and the friends
Take away my heart from this dusty land
They call me the rogue
But I’ll keep on looting, my friend
Let’s haul the rope again

Like a flash in the morning
See the sun rising
Don’t let be taken
Just run far away
My whole lotta Rosie
Snoring on the ground
Her breath shakes the ceiling
Blowing from her mouth
You don’t know what I’ve been through

Hold again
For the last sea and the friends
Take away my heart from this dusty land
They call me the rogue
But I’ll keep on looting, my friend
Let’s haul the rope again

Hold again
For the last sea and the friends
Take away my heart from this dusty land
They call me the rogue
But I’ll keep on looting, my friend
Let’s haul the rope again

Hold again
For the last sea and the friends
Take away my heart from this dusty land
They call me the rogue
But I’ll keep on looting, my friend
Let’s haul the rope again
