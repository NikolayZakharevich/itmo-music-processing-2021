I will dance with another girl
If you’d love to love to see me do
I would stand right in front of her
Like I’m standing right in front of you, yes I’d do
I could tell her many words of love
I would always want to tell you
I would kiss her so many times
I could never never never do the same to you
Leave Me Alone, I don’t believe in
Friends that don’t show
Secret feelings
And if you go when I’m sleeping
I know that you’ll come
Back and say that you
Leave Me Alone, but I can’t promise
I will be home, I’ve seen enough
Now I’m done
I could drive a car all night long
Just to meet you in the morning lights
I could leave and write another song
But can’t help falling out of love tonight
Leave Me Alone, I don’t believe in
Friends that don’t show
Secret feelings
And if you go when I’m sleeping
I know that you’ll come
Back and say that you
Leave Me Alone, no I can’t promise
I will be home, I’ve seen enough
Now I’m done
