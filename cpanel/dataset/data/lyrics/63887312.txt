Do you still believe the myth?
Do you still believe the hype?
Still following the piper
Like the corpse that draws the flies
It was all just a load of bullshit
Born of the fake fucking news
That you read out like the gospel
And you still believe it’s true
It’s easy to see a conspiracy
When the world is so damn flat
It is easy to see a conspiracy
When the world is full of hate
Never just believe
Any old shit you read
Mixing urban myths
With science fiction
Never just repeat
What someone else believes
Spreading hate and fear
With pure fiction
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up now!
And start using your own brain
Do we still believe in ghosts?
Do we still believe the rumours?
Of someone throwing apples
Over the walls of Eden
It was all just a load of bullshit
Born of the fake fucking news
That you read out like the gospel
Full of facts from a social feed
It’s easy to see a conspiracy
When the world is so damn flat
It’s easy to see a conspiracy
When the world is full of hate
Never just believe
Any old shit you read
Mixing urban myths
With science fiction
Never just repeat
What someone else believes
Spreading hate and fear
With pure fiction
Shut the fuck up!
You crowned yourself the king
Of the weak and the cowards
You crowned yourself the king
Without using your own brain
(Shut the fuck up)
(Shut the fuck up)
(Shut the fuck up)
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up now!
