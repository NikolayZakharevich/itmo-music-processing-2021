Twas the landlords that drove us from Ireland.
The high rents were our prison walls.
Then the famine came 'round,
And blackened the ground.
And the auctioneers hammer did fall.
Farewell to the ones I adore.
And the land I will see never more.
For I’m saying goodbye,
With a tear in me eye,
To the dear little shamrock shore.
A ship lies in Fairbury harbor.
Barely safe over the foa.
But to Halifax town,
I soon will be bound,
Far away from me native home.
Farewell to the ones I adore,
And the land I will see never more.
For I’m saying goodbye,
With a tear in me eye,
To the dear little shamrock shore.
Well they all came to wish me safe journey.
The parting still grieves on me mind.
Me parents so dear,
Me friends far and near,
And the girl I left behind.
Farewell to the ones I adore,
And the land I will see never more.
For I’m saying goodbye,
With a tear in me eye,
To the dear little shamrock shore.
There’s work to be had if your able.
The new world has treated me fine.
With me shovel and spade,
I toil at me trade,
But riches will never be mine.
Farewell to the ones I adore,
And the land I will see never more.
For I’m saying goodbye,
With a tear in me eye,
To the dear little shamrock shore.
Well rivers still run to the ocean.
The wee birds on feathered wings soar.
I dream of the day,
When home I will stray,
To the dear little shamrock shore.
Farewell to the ones I adore,
And the land I will see never more.
For I’m saying goodbye,
With a tear in me eye,
To the dear little shamrock shore.
Farewell to the ones I adore,
And the land I will see never more.
For I’m saying goodbye,
With a tear in me eye,
To the dear little shamrock shore.
To the dear little shamrock shore.
