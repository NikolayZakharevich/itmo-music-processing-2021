I am not a victim
I'm not a fool
I am not a pawn to be abused
It was never real
It was never love
And I've had enough

I don't want to listen
I don't want to try
'Cause you know that I'll never miss you or the way you lie
I don't want to listen
I don't want to stay
But I've finally got the strength in me to say

I'm gonna find somebody
To treat me better than you
Gonna find somebody
To treat me better than you
(Treat me better than)
I'm sick and tired of the things you've done but
You won't be laughing when I find someone
Somebody
To treat me better than you
(Treat me better than)

You think you're funny
I'm not amused
You will never win, I'll never lose
'Cause now I'm better
In spite of you
In spite of you

Now you want to listen
Now you want to try
But you know that it's too late to apologise
So just think about me
What you want to say
As you stand alone and watch me walk away

I'm gonna find somebody
To treat me better than you
Gonna find somebody
To treat me better than you
(Treat me better than)
I'm sick and tired of the things you've done but
You won't be laughing when I find someone
Somebody
To treat me better than you

Somebody that ain't like, ain't like you
Somebody that ain't like you
Somebody that ain't like, ain't like you
Somebody that ain't like you
(Treat me better than)
Somebody that ain't like, ain't like you
Somebody that ain't like you

I'm gonna find some-
(Body)
I'm gonna find somebody (Somebody)
To treat me better than you (Somebody)
I'm gonna find somebody (Somebody)
To treat me better than you (Somebody)
(Treat me better than)
(Somebody)
