You're never gonna make it, you're not good enough
There's a million other people with the same stuff
You really think you're different? Man, you must be kiddin'
Think you're gonna hit it, but you just don't get it
It's impossible, it's not probable
You're irresponsible, too many obstacles
You gotta stop it, yo, you gotta take it slow
You can't be a pro, don't waste your time no more
Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?
I don't give a damn if you say you disapprove
I'm gonna make my move, I'm gonna make it soon
And I'll do it 'cause it's what I want to fucking do
'cause all these opinions and all these positions
They're coming in millions, they're blocking your vision
But no, you can't listen, that shit is all fiction
'cause you hold the power as long as you're driven

You're never gonna make it
There's no way that you make it
Yeah, maybe you can fake it
But you're never gonna make it
Are you just gonna take that?
Make 'em take it all back
Don't tell me you believe that
Are you just gonna take that?

Or will you fucking fight back?
Or will you fucking fight back?

You ain't gonna make it, you ain't never ever gonna break it
You can never beat 'em, man, they're better than you, face it
Thinking that they give a damn, you're not thinking straight kid
Nah, they don't give a damn, you got what I'm sayin'?
I'm not fucking playin', I'll give it to you straight, man
There's too many others and you're not that great, man
Stop what you're sayin', stop what you're makin'
Everybody here knows that you're just fakin'
Nah, I don't wanna hear it anymore
I don't wanna hear it anymore
All these fucking thoughts, they are not what I need anymore
I'm about to shut the motherfucking door
On all you poor ass haters with your heads in the clouds
Talkin' out loud, so proud
You better shut your goddamn mouths
Before I do more than speak out, it's about to head south

You're never gonna make it
There's no way that you make it
Yeah, maybe you can fake it
But you're never gonna make it
Are you just gonna take that?
Make 'em take it all back
Don't tell me you believe that
Are you just gonna take that?

Or will you fucking fight back?
Or will you fucking fight back?
