Wait indoors
Slept to waste the time until I Hear the sound
Of your footsteps climbing up the
Porch as it rains
Trembling voices propogate these rooms
I keep my eyes closed and listen to the noise
Pull the sound that lingers through the space that fills this house around
Was I alone in dreams of something good?
Water stains
On the pillow where I lay my head
Do they say that I was sleeping
When away do I Wait, shadows climb windows, fading days as I Trace the light that flickers through the room
Pull the sound that lingers through the space that fills this house around
Was I alone in dreams of something good?
