Our day will come and we’ll have everything
We’ll share the joys falling in love can bring
No one can tell me that I’m too young to know
I love you so and you love me Our day will come, If we just wait awhile
No tears for us, Think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic because we’ll always stay
In love this way, Our day will come
Ooh-Hoo-Hoo
(Our day will come and we’ll have everything)
(We'll share the joys falling in love can bring)
No one can tell me that I’m too young to know
I love you so and you love me Our day will come, If we just wait awhile
No tears for us, Think love and wear a smile
Our dreams have magic because we’ll always stay
In love this way, Our day,
Our Day will come
(Our Day, Our Day)
(Our day will come)
(Our Day, Our Day)
(Our day will come)
