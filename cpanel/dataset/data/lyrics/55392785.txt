Fine like Omotola
She get money like Otedola
She wan get more dollar
She no dey find anybody wey go control her no no
Say she be foreigner, and these days she don dey popular
She say she no get e no time for me now
She no dey answer when I’m calling her
Baby show me what you can do
If I light your candle
Shey you go fit tando
Make I show you what I can do
Like as you come through
I go give you bamboo now
Baby your body dey for my eye
Baby your body dey for my eye
Girl you know say you are murder them you are real killy killy
Girl e be you be the talk of the town really really
Girl everybody dey look when you enter the building
Tell me what to do; girl Im for real
Girl I’ve been scheming, plotting, planning…
Fuck a plan A and move to plan B
come any times the perfect timing
So you should take a chance and try me
It should be pon me that you’re whining
No other girl can satisfy me
Girl me and you could be vibing
But you keep playing these games and hiding
Fine-Fine like Omotola
She get money like Otedola
She wan get more dollar
She no dey find anybody wey go control her
Say she be foreigner, and these days she don dey popular
She say no get time for me now
She no dey answer when I am calling her
Baby show me what you can do
If I light your candle
Shey you go fit tando naa
Make I show you what I can do
Like as you come through
I go give you bamboo now
Baby your body dey for my eye
Baby your body dey for my eye
