Not all horses are gonna need blinders
Not all seekers will be finders
Even the gurus only yet to know
Yet there is a path you call your own

Seekers
Finders
Which one are you
Which one am I
We are all just headless riders
Some crack right through
Some only try

Life quest for a unity
Death propels the community to
Break all the dividers
To rip off the masks and tear off the blinders
Mind is stuck on survival soul
It knows no rival in
its one and the onliness
It is the seeker and finder of holiness

Seekers
Finders
Which one are you
Which one am I
We are all just headless riders
Some crack right through
Some only try

Words turn flesh
So go feed your tigers
Light one, dark one both are in pre-flight stance
Which one will defeat the other
It's the one that turns fight into dance

Seekers
Finders
Which one are you
Which one am I
We are all just headless riders
Inside one whole-seeing eye
