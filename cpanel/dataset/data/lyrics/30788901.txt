And this is just another sad song
I can’t deny that I’ve been needing one
And that the world is always at fault
And we did nothing, how did we do wrong?
And I’ve been thinking that when we thought
The world would break us that we weren’t wrong
But it’s just never been the world outside
And sonder kinda has me terrified
And I’m so sorry I can’t find the time
Spent all my days over-preoccupied
And I’ve been thinkin' 'bout how I’d react
If you were me and I was ghosted out
And I know I should try more
But I’ve been so caught in my own small shit that I can’t see
Past the nothing around me here
But I’ve been trying really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
Really fuckin' hard to just let go
Really fuckin' hard not to try so hard
And realize I’ve nowhere left to go
