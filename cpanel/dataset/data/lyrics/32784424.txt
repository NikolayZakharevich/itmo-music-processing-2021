Threw the helmet down
Nailed to the wire
Known by the sin of our fathers
Let it all come out and burn like a fire
We’ll shout a little bit louder
Cause the night still has a thousand nights
And when the truth is brought to light
You and I, you and I will be
Free, free, free
Yeah we’ll be
Free, free, free
Break through every door
And the stakes get higher
Hard evidence is power
Turn the noose of war
Trade proof for the liar
We’ll shout a little bit louder
Cause secrets tell a million lies
But the truth is always brought to light
So you and I, you and I will be
Free, free, free
Yeah we’ll be
Free, free, free
Secrets tell a million lies
To build the walls they hide behind
But the truth is always brought to light
Brought to light
Secrets tell a million lies
But the night still has a thousand nights
And when the truth is brought to light
You and I
Will be free, free, free
Free, free, free
Free, free, free (we'll be free)
Free, free, free (we'll be free)
