This used to be my playground.
This used to be my childhood dream.
This used to be the place I ran to Whenever I wasi in need of a friend.
Why did it have to end?
And why do They always say
Don’t look back.
Keep your head held high.
Don’t ask them why
Because life is short and before you know, you’re feeling old and your heart is breaking.
Don’t hold onto the past.
Well, that’sToo much to ask.
This used to be my playground,(Used to be).
This used to be my childhood dream.
This used to be the place I ran to Whenever I was in need of a friend.
Why did it have to end?
And why do they always say
No regrets. But I wish that you
Were here with me. Well then,
There’s hope yet.
I can see your face in our secret place.
You’re not just a memory.
Say good-bye to yesterday.
Those are words I’llNever say (I'll never say).
This used to be my playground,(Used to be).
This used to be our pride and joy.
This used to be the place we ran to That no one in the world could dare destroy.
This used to be our playground,(Used to be).
This used to be our childhood dream.
This used to be the place we ran to.
I Wish you were standing here with me.
This used to be our playground,(Used to be).
This used to be our childhood dream.
This used to be the place we ran to.
The best things in life are always free, wishing you were here with me
