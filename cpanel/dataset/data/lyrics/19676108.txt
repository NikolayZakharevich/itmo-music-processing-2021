There’s some who say a Sailor’s life is full of sport and leisure
Just a grand old time upon the raging main.
But boys the work is tough and there’s little time for pleasure
When you’re fighting rummeling seas and hurricanes.
So heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
The anchor’s weighed, the course it set, and now we’re homeward bound!
Heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
Tonight we’ll be a dancing with the girls of Derrtyown!
The captain and the crew are well seasoned on the ocean,
So what care we for weather rain or shine?
Our ship is sound and sure, and when she’s in full motion,
There’s not a faster clipper on the line!
So heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
The anchor’s weighed, the course it set, and now we’re homeward bound!
Heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
Tonight we’ll be a dancing with the girls of Derrtyown!
We’ve sailed to South America, New Zealand and Australia,
To Halifax, New York and Baltimore.
Can never report of call. Sure we’ve stories to regail ya'.
For on the shore we likes to rant and roar!
So heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
The anchor’s weighed, the course it set, and now we’re homeward bound!
Heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
Tonight we’ll be a dancing with the girls of Derrtyown!
So heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
The anchor’s weighed, the course it set, and now we’re homeward bound!
Heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
Tonight we’ll be a dancing with the girls of Derrtyown!
We’re sailing up Loch Voil. Thank God the journey’s ended.
There’s lassies waiting there at Derry’s quay!
We’ve money for to spend and girls to help us spend it.
We’ll live like kings until we sail away!
So heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
The anchor’s weighed, the course it set, and now we’re homeward bound!
Heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
Tonight we’ll be a dancing with the girls of Derrtyown!
So heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
The anchor’s weighed, the course it set, and now we’re homeward bound!
Heave away! (Heave away!) Haul away! (Haul away!)
Tonight we’ll be a dancing with the girls of Derrtyown!
