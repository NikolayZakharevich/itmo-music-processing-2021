I'm a blond single girl, in a fantasy world
Dress me up, take your time, I'm your dolly
You’re my doll, rock’n’roll, feel the glamour in pink
Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
You can touch, you can play, you can say: «I'm always yours»

I'm a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Come on Barbie, let’s go party
Come on Barbie, let’s go party
Come on Barbie, let’s go party

Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
Come jump in, bimbo friend, let  do it again
Hit the town, fool around, let’s go party
You can touch, you can play, you can say: «I'm always yours»
You can touch, you can play, you can say: «I'm always yours»

I'm a barbie girl, in a barbie world
Life in plastic, it’s fantastic!
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation
Come on Barbie, let’s go party
Come on Barbie, let’s go party
Come on Barbie, let’s go party

I'm a barbie girl
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
