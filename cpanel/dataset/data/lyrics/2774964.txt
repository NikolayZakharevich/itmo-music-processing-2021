I don't know
I don't know
I don't know anymore
Thought I had
Thought I had it under control

Hear my voice, here it goes
Hear it louder than most
Here it goes, here it goes
(1 2 3 4)

It's not worth it
It's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over,
You don't have to throw it away.

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps you
Get control (take it out on me)
So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps you
Get control

You try to move, try to move
But you don't wanna lose
So afraid, so afraid
You don't want it to fade

Hear my voice, here it goes
Hear it louder than most
Let it go, let it (1 2 3 4)

It's not worth it
It's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over,
You don't have to throw it away.

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps you
Get control (take it out on me)
So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go (take it out on me)
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps you
Get control
