This was just meant to be
You are coming back to me
'Cause this is pure love
'Cause this is pure love

Mikham keh vaghty khaby
Kenareh to beshinam
Ageh yeh vaght khabam bord
Baz khabeh toro bebinam

Atreh nafashayeh to
Beh tanam bepicheh
Kash bedoony
Keh zendegy bito hicheh

This was just meant to be
You are coming back to me
'Cause, this is pure love
'Cause, this is pure love

I know you are more afraid
Then I'll say I will wait
'Cause this is pure love
'Cause this is pure love

Mikham tane ghashangeto
To baghalam begiram
Begam ageh nabashi
Karam tamoomeo
Bedooneh to mimiram

Mikham labato roo labam
Bezary ta hamisheh
Begam keh zendegy digeh
Bedooneh to nemisheh

This was just meant to be
You are coming back to me
'Cause this is pure love
'Cause this is pure love

I know you are more afraid
Then I'll say I will wait
'Cause, this is pure love
'Cause, this is pure love

Bito delam migireh
Amma zamooneh migeh
Keh digeh kheili direh

This was just meant to be
You are coming back to me
