Every time I walk on by
Stroll along your street
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to repeat

And I was walking on your floor
Begging to get more
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to ask for

So leave my broken bones
I'll take the load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
You need a sinner I will

Every time I walk on by
Stroll along your street
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to repeat

So leave my broken bones
I'll take the load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
You need a sinner I will
So leave my broken bones
I'll take the load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
You need a sinner I will

Don't you know
Don't you know what to say
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know
Don't you know what to say
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know
Don't you know what to say
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know
Don't you know what to say
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again
