Lonelyness is my only guest
Who visits me alone at night
When it comes I light two candles
Just the way it was
And pretend the flames become your eyes
Emptyness is a friend I guess
The shadow played upon the wall
If I let the candles take me
I can see your face
And remember hearing someone call your name
My candles are crying O-o-o-o-h
My candles are crying O-o-o-o-h
They’re crying for you
They’re waiting for you
I’m waiting for you
Is it you knocking at my door
Or maybe just a ghostly wind
How I wish that you were here
Sitting by my side
And you’ll bring me back to life again tonight
My candles are crying O-o-o-o-h
My candles are crying O-o-o-o-h
They’re crying for you
They’re waiting for you
I’m waiting for you

My candles are crying O-o-o-o-h
My candles are crying O-o-o-o-h
They’re crying for you
They’re waiting for you
I’m waiting for you
