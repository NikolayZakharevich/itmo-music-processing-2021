With a sigh
You turn away
With a deepening heart
No words to say
You will find
That the world has changed forever
The trees are now turning from green to gold
And the sun is now fading
I wish I could hold you closer
With a sigh
You turn away
With a deepening heart
No words to say
You will find
That the world has changed forever
The trees are now turning from green to gold
And the sun is now fading
I wish I could hold you closer
