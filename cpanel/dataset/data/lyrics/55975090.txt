I see a flame and I feel the heat
You set a fire burning deep in me
I got this feeling like I'm falling in love
You take me places I used to only dream of
You got a hold of my mind
You got a hold of my body
Don't let me go

I don't want this to be over
Don't want this to end
The morning's getting closer
But we can still pretend
Turn the record over
Play that song again
Dance a little closer
I don't want this to end

I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end

I feel the sun pushing at the moon
The day is breaking much too soon
I don't know how you got me feeling this way
Caught in your gravity and I can't pull away
You got a hold of my mind
You got a hold of my body
Don't let me go

I don't want this to be over
Don't want this to end
The morning's getting closer
But we can still pretend
Turn the record over
Play that song again
Dance a little closer
I don't want this to end

I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end

Put it on, put it on repeat
Put it on, put it on repeat
Put it on, put it on repeat
Put it on, put it on repeat
Put it on, put it on repeat
Put it on, put it on repeat
Don't want this to be over
Don't want this to end

I don't want this to be over
Don't want this to end
The morning's getting closer
But we can still pretend
Turn the record over
Play that song again
Dance a little closer
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
I don't want this to end
