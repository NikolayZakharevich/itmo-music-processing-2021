So its halloween
And you feel like dancin
And you feel like shinin
And you feel like letting loose
Whatcha gonna be Babe, you better know
And you better plan
Better plan all day
Better plan all week
Better plan all month
Better plan all year
Youre dressed up like a clown
Putting on your act
Its the only time all year
Youll ever admit that
I can see your eyes
I can see your brain
Baby, nothings changed
Youre still hiding in a mask
You take your fun seriously
No, dont blow this years chance
Tomorrow your mold goes back on After halloween
You go to work today
Youll go to work tomorrow
Shitfaced tonight
Youll brag about it for months
Remember what I did
Remember what I was
Back on halloween
But whats in between
Where are your ideas
You sit around and dream
For next halloween
Why not everyday
Are you so afraid
What will people say
After halloween
Because your role is planned for you
Theres nothing you can do But stop and think it through
But what will the boss say to you
And what will your girlfriend say to you
And the people out on the street they might glare at you
And whadya know youre pretty self-conscious too
So you run back and stuff yourselves in rigid business costumes
Only at night to score is your leather uniform exhumed
Why dont you take your social regulations
And shove em up your ass
