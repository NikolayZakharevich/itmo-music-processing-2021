When I give these books away will my ink betray me?
Will my stories resist wings and grow feet and convince me that I’m boasting?
Or will my psalms seek the company of lonely breaths?
Will they inspire subtle lovers to kiss with mouths they don’t have yet?
Boy, whoever reads about how much I adore you
I hope my words bring them something new, something new
Ooh child bless your hear, keep a tender heart
Heart
Heart
With you I can empty myself of all my rivers and become a remarkable sky
How could I keep these love documents to myself?
How could I restrict what’s given me life?
Today I’ll find a kind and burrowing creature that can carry these pages until
browned
He’ll recite the details of your love with his family
And what was once a whisper will become a deep rumbling sound
Ooh child bless a heart, keep a tender heart
(I'll keep a tender heart)
Heart
Heart
Heart
Heart
(Oh, I’ll keep my tender heart)
Boy thank you for showing me how to be gentle (heart)
I have courage to share your love boldly (heart)
(Heart)
(Heart)
