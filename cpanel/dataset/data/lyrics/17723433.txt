Gold,
That ancient light,
weighing on your shoulders,
and the river of time,
love is all that´s left to lose,
love is all that´s left to lose,
ooooo
Lost, lost,
but not alone anymore,
Lost, Lost,
but not alone anymore,
This ancient light,
This ancient light,
mmmmm
Ghosts,
Their voices all resting,
In your bones,
and the river of time
Love is all that´s left to lose,
Love is all that´s left to lose,
ooooo
Lost, lost
But not alone anymore,
Lost, lost,
But not alone anymore,
This ancient light,
This ancient light,
This ancient light,
This ancient light,
oooo
