Where do we go from here? Something came in with the night
Snow came in heavy, my boys and me wandering blind, yeah
Well, it's temporary darling
Now that bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan heard all our lines
Meant what I said, I want all of this all of the time

Oh, when I'm gone
At the dun with the dawn
Well, that's all I could want

We were young, we were free
Come on now, let it go
We were young, we were free
I was living in the cold, I'm coming home
Perfect line to open with
Her heart was never meant for this
Ooh, we're never over it
We were young, we were free, yeah yeah

All that she said to me stays with me, never to die
Held me brand new in the silence that went through the pines
Like I said already, darling
I don't want you looking back at all the ghosts left behind
Know you'll stay near me so road remains hopeful this time

We were young, we were free
Come on now, let it go
We were young, we were free
I was living in the cold, I'm coming home
Perfect line to open with
Her heart was never meant for this
Ooh, we're never over it
We were young, we were free, yeah yeah

Keepin' another for a night, keepin' another for a night
All I'll ever know, baby, we were bound to burn
Keepin' another for a night, keepin' another for a night
All I'll ever know, baby, we were bound to burn
Baby, we were bound to burn

We were young, we were free
Come on now, let it go
We were young, we were free
I was living in the cold, I'm coming home
Perfect line to open with
Her heart was never meant for this
Ooh, we're never over it
We were young, we were free, yeah yeah

Oh, when I'm gone
At the dun with the dawn
Well, that's all I could want
