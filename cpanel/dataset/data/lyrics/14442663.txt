Get up, Get up, Get up,
I’m a show you everything I’ve got inside
I won’t give up, give up,
Never backing down this is my fight
(Come on!)
How do you live, when every finger’s pointing in your face?
How do you give your heart to something only you embrace?
How do you put your mind to something that you love,
When you were growing up everyone told you that you weren’t good enough?
Good enough would work for me,
Instead of love you hurt me deep,
Broke my trust and watched me bleed,
Ignored my pleas and squashed my dreams.
Everything hiding underneath is coming out for you to see.
The screams kept hidden down beneath,
A broken spirit, are finally free
Get up, Get up, Get up,
I’m a show you everything I’ve got inside
I won’t give up, give up,
Never backing down this is my fight
Everything we do in life has got to be for something.
I won’t go down without a fight, no I won’t die for nothing.
You held me under too long. I see a coming end.
Take back your hand, you’re not my friend; to me you’re fucking dead!
All the things you did and do showed me the colors inside you,
I now know all your hidden truths. If I were you, shit, I’d lie, too!
It’s my turn now, I’ll burn you down, nowhere to run and hide for you.
It’s tried and true, and I’ll get through. I’ll watch your spirit die in you.
Get up, Get up, Get up,
I’m a show you everything I’ve got inside
I won’t give up, give up,
Never backing down this is my fight
Every word you said had you thinking in your head
You’d leave me here for dead, but I’m alive.
Get up, Get up, Get up,
I’m a show you everything I’ve got inside
You brought me down in ways I can’t imagine.
You made me believe IT’S TRUE
(It's what I’ve got inside, this is my fight)
I hate the way you drag me down!
I’m not afraid, 'cause this ends now!
I hate the way you drag me down!
NOW! This ends now!
Get up, Get up, Get up, (Never gave up!)
I’m a show you everything I’ve got inside! (Come on!)
I won’t give up, give up, (I'm never giving up!)
Never backing down, this is my fight! (Yeah!)
Every word you said had you thinking in your head
You’d leave me here for dead, but I’m alive. (I won!)
Get up, Get up, Get up, (Now I’m getting up!)
I’m a show you everything I’ve got inside!
I hate the way you drag me down!
I’m not afraid, 'cause this ends now!
