well i used to be a rover and i rambled all around
and i never felt the urge to settle down
but in the county antrim down ballymena waysly cupid came a-calling me one day
and from the very start sure she stole away me heart
since i saw her standing there
and with her i will stay until me dying day
and i met her at the gracehill fair
she was lovely as the roses and as graceful as a swan
and her lilting voice would brighten any dawn
i knew id be in heaven just to hold her in me arms
i was smitten by her beauty and her char
and from the very start sure she stole away me heart
since i saw her standing there
and with her i will stay until me dying day
and i met her at the gracehill fair
well the fair it runs from april until lammas days are done
and all are in good humour having fun
theres fiddlers, theres pipers and theres dancers on the green
and the finest wares that you have ever seen
and from the very start sure she stole away me heart
since i saw her standing there
and with her i will stay until me dying day
and i met her at the gracehill fair
now me roving days are over and im happy for to bide
for the lovely lass i met became me bride
each day i count me blessings for true love we do share
since i met her at the gracehill fair
and from the very start sure she stole away me heart
since i saw her standing there
and with her i will stay until me dying day
and i met her at the gracehill fair
and from the very start sure she stole away me heart
since i saw her standing there
and with her i will stay until me dying day
and i met her at the gracehill fair
