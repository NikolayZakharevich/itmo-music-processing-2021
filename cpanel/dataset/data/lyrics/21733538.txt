Dance till the shoes fall off your feet
Drink till the well runs dry
Kiss all the lips for miles around
Laugh till I have to cry
I’ve tried pretending not to see
The fool you’re making out of me
I’m the one who gave my heart and soul
To help when you were down
Now you take the love I gave
Drag it all around
There’s something I think you don’t know
It’s you you’re really hurting so
I’m afraid you might get burned
In the heat of ice too dry
Baby don’t you know that you could fall
Flying so high every night
Dance till the shoes fall off your feet (4x)
