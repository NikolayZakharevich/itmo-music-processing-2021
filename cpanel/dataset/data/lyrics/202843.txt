The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
Strange what desire will make foolish people do.
And I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you,
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.

No, I don't wanna fall in love
No, I don't wanna fall in love
With you
With you

What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you

What a wicked thing to say
You never felt that way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you

And I don't wanna fall in love
No, I don't wanna fall in love
With you
With you

World was on fire and no one could save me but you.
Strange what desire will make foolish people do.
And I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you,
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.

No, I don't wanna fall in love
No, I don't wanna fall in love
No I
No I
Nobody loves no one
