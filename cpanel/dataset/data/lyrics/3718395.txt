Now let the day just slip away so the dark night may
Watch over you
Velvet blue, silent true, it embraces your heart and
Your soul. Nocturne
Never cry, never sigh, you don’t have to wonder why
Always be, always see, come and dream the night
With me, Nocturne
Have no fear when the night draws near
And fills you with dreams and desires
Like a child asleep so warm so deep
You will find me there waiting for you
Nocturne
Never cry, never sigh, you don’t have to wonder why
Always be, always see, come and dream the night
With me, Nocturne
Now the darkness lay, it will give way
When the dark night delivers the day, Nocturne
