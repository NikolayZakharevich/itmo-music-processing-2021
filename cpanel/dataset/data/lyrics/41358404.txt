I'm just not sure whether my heart is working 
And yours is beating double time 
Deep down you know I ain't even worth it 
It's not enough, babe, all I do is make you cry 
Like ooh whoa, ooh whoa I know, 
I do this every time 
Like ooh whoa, I know 
That I just got to say what's on my mind 

You deserve better, better, better than me 
Might be what you want, but I'm not what you need 
You're better, better than you even realize 
You deserve better, better, better than me 
Might be what you want, but I want you to see 
You're better off without me in your life 
And I hope you find somebody else 
That'll love you like nobody else 
And I hope he gives you something real, oh, I love you still 
But you deserve better, better, better, better 

Give up on me, 'cause, babe, I'm hopeless 
The more it hurts, the more it's right
You know I loved, I just never showed you 
It'll be too late when you're with some other guy 
Like ooh whoa, ooh whoa I know,
I do this every time 
Like ooh whoa, I know
That I just got to say what's on my mind 

You deserve better, better, better than me 
Might be what you want, but I'm not what you need 
You're better, better than you even realize 
You deserve better, better, better than me 
Might be what you want, but I want you to see 
You're better off without me in your life 

And I hope you find somebody else 
That'll love you like nobody else 
And I hope he gives you something real, oh, I love you still 
But you deserve better, better, better, better 

Might be what you want, but not what you need 
Baby, oh yeah 
You deserve better, better, better than me 
Might be what you want, but I'm not what you need 
You're better, better than you even realize 
You deserve better, better, better than me 
Might be what you want, but I want you to see 
You're better off without me in your life
And I hope you find somebody else 
That'll love you like nobody else 
And I hope he gives you something real, oh, I love you still 
But you deserve better, better, better, better
