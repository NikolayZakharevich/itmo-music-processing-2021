If love was a word
I don’t understand
The simplest sound
With four letters
Whatever it was
I’m over it now
With eyer day
It gets better, it gets better
Are you loving the pain, loving the pain
And with every day, every day
I try to move on Whatever it was, whatever it was
There’s nothing now
You changed
New Age
I’m walking away
From everything I had
I need a room
With new colours
There was a time
When I didn’t mind
Living the life
The simplest sound
With four letters
Are you loving to pain me, loving to pain
And with every day, with every day
I try to move on Whatever it was, whatever it was
There’s nothing now
You changed
New Age
Loving the pain, loving the pain
And with every day, every day
I try to move on Whatever it was, whatever it was
There’s nothing now
You changed
New Age
