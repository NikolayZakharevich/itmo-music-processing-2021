Looking up from underneath,
Fractured moonlight on the sea.
Reflections still look the same to me,
As before I went under.
And it's peaceful in the deep,
Cathedral where you can not breathe,
No need to pray, no need to speak,
Now I'm under
And it's breaking over me.
A thousand miles onto the sea bed,
I found the place to rest my head.

Never let me go, never let me go,
Never let me go, never let me go.

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me,
And honest devotion was rushing out of me,
And the crushes of heaven for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean delivered me.

Though, the pressure's hard to take,
It's the only way I can escape,
It seems a heavy choice to make.
Now I am under
And it's breaking over me.
A thousand miles down to the sea bed,
I found the place to rest my head.

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me,
And honest devotion was rushing out of me,
And the crushes of heaven, for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean delivered me.

And it's over,
And I'm goin' under,
But I'm not givin' up!
I'm just givin' in.

Woooah...
Slipping underneath.
Woooah...
So cold, but so sweet...

In the arms of the ocean, so sweet and so cold,
And honest devotion I never knew at all,
And the crushes of heaven for a sinner released,
And the arms of the ocean delivered me.

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

Delivered me...

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

Delivered me...

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

And it's over,
And I'm goin' under,
But I'm not givin' up!
I'm just givin' in.

Woooah...
Slipping underneath.
Woooah...
So cold, but so sweet...
