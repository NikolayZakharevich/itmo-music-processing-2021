Mercy for the Elves
Who guard their lives with faith
Our hands do weigh them down
But their kind hearts will forgive the weight
Arlathan fell
So deep onto the ocean floor
Currents of hate
Will so challenge their fate
Mercy for the Elves
Who marched with us through fire
Stood with Andraste
As she rose against the Empire
Can we pay the cost
For the allies we have lost in fear
Our hands of pain
Will so threaten their name
If we climb through our doubt
We can sympathize
When the slightest unite
Then a giant will rise
Slightest unite
Then a giant will rise
Mercy for the Elves
Who wander through the night
Dalish father roams
Will the Dalish son survive the fight?
How can we deny
What their numbers can supply the realm?
Slightest unite
Then a giant will rise
When the slightest unite
Then a giant will rise.
