Wow, am I feeling good, man?
Let me say this now

Here and now let's get this straight
Boogaloo baby, I made it great
Because I gave it the latin beat
You know, child, I'm kind of hard to beat
Just commence your feet to skate
Pick up your arms and make 'em shake
Baby if you think you're shy
Do me a favor, honey, go some place and hide

He he he he
Yeah, baby
I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
My boogaloo, I need it baby
I like it like that
I like it like that
I said I like it like that
And I want it like that
I like it like that
I got the soul, I got the thing
I said I like it like that
I got the soul, baby look at me
I like it like that
Yeah, baby
I said I like it like that
I like it like that
I like it like that

Stomp your feet if you think I'm neat
Clap your hands if you want some more
Stomp your feet if you think I'm neat
Clap your hands if you want some more

I like it like that
Yeah, baby
I said I like it like that
I like it like that
I like it like that
And I want it like that
I said I like it like that
Give it to me, do it to me, give it to me
I like it like that
Yeah, baby
I said I like it like that
I've got the soul, I've got the thing
I like it like that
I've got the soul, baby look at me
I said I like it like that
Yeah,baby
I like it like that

Stomp your feet if you think I'm neat
Clap your hands if you want some more
Stomp your feet if you think I'm neat
Clap your hands if you want some more

You're looking good now
Let me feel your soul
Listen to me, don't be shy
Join the party, say like I say
Like this, see?, you're ready now? Yeah!
OK
I like it, I like it, I like it like that
I like it, I like it, I like it like that
I like it, I like it, I like it like that
I like it, I like it, I like it like that
I like it, I like it, I like it like that

I like it like that
Yeah, baby
I said I like it like that
Before I go I wanna say
I like it like that
My boogaloo, I need it baby
I said I like it like that
Yeah, baby
