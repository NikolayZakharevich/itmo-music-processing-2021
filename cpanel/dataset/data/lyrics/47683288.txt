If I could go, go into my heart
And search for all the places I left the spark
To find a way, way back to the olden days
Before it started falling apart

Singing songs and telling stories
About when we were young
Running crazy through the memories
When we never could be wrong

We would be strong like superheroes
High on sugar
We would stay up all night until the sun comes up, yeah
Running crazy through the memories
Innocent and young

If I could go, go into my heart
And search for all the places I left the spark
To find a way, way back to the olden days
Before it started falling apart
I might find it waiting in the corner
Somewhere in the dark
If I could go, go to where it all began
Yes, I would take it back to the start
Back to the start
Back to the start

A little lazy, it was always easy
But we were moving on
Endless daydreams as far as they see
Of what we might become

We would be strong like superheroes
High on sugar
We would stay up all night until the sun comes up, yeah
Running crazy through the memories
Innocent and young

If I could go, go into my heart
And search for all the places I left the spark
To find a way, way back to the olden days
Before it started falling apart
I might find it waiting in the corner
Somewhere in the dark
If I could go, go to where it all began
Yes, I would take it back to the start
Back to the start (Start, start)
Back to the start (Start, start)

I might find it waiting in the corner
Somewhere in the dark
If I could go, go to where it all began
Yes, I would take it back to the start
Back to the start (Start, start)
Take us back to start
Back to the start (Start, start)
Oh, back to the start
Back to the start
