When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger we came from?

Burning like embers, falling, tender
Longing for the days of no surrender
Years ago

And well you know
Smoke em if you got em cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you

I'll never get to heaven cause I don't know how
Let's raise a glass
Or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Oh
Tell me are they lost on you
Oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you

Oh
Is that lost on you
Oh
Baby is that lost on you
Is that lost on you

Wishing I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you

Let's take a drink of ever this can turn around
Let's raise a glass
Or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Oh
Tell me are they lost on you
Oh
Just that you could cut me loose
Oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you

Oh
Is that lost on you
Oh
Baby is that lost on you
Is that lost on you

Let's raise a glass
Or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Oh
Tell me are they lost on you
Oh

Trusted you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you
Is that lost on you
