Heartache mender take my hand
We'll bury the past forever under Hollywood land
A bottle of red can raise the dead
Mmh-hm, if you give me your number
Ooh, I'll never make you wonder

I'm starting to feel a certain way about ya
It isn't my M.O., oh, no, no, no, ooh
And now that I got my lovin' arms around ya
I'm not gonna let go, oh, no, no, no

A light in the dark, the spark of somethin' new
The cinema plays but I can't take my eyes off you
A stroke of luck, we both end up alone
Or is it the stars alignin' like these tombs of stone?
And Johnny Ramone can play a song for us
Mmh-hm, with Rudy Valentino
Up and away we go

I'm starting to feel a certain way about ya
It isn't my M.O., oh, no, no, no, ooh
And now that I got my lovin' arms around ya
I'm not gonna let go, oh, no, no, no

M.O., doo-doo-doo-doo
Let go, doo-doo-doo-doo
M.O., doo-doo-doo-doo
Mmh, I'm ready when you say so
Oh, Ponyboy stay gold

I'm starting to feel a certain way about ya
It isn't my M.O., oh, no, no, no, ooh
And now that I got my lovin' arms around ya
I'm not gonna let go, oh, no, no, no

No, I'm not gonna let go, oh, no, no, no
No, I'm not gonna let go, oh, no, no, no
No, I'm not gonna let go, oh, no, no, no
No, I'm not gonna let go, oh, no, no, no
Oh-oh
