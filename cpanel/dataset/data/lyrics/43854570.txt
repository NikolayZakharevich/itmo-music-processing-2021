Don't give a damn about the rumours
They have never bothered me
Yeah and I might be a fool
But I'm lucky that my eyes can see

And I'm in love with the rush boy, love with the rush boy
That you make me feel
Don't give a damn about the rumours
Yeah, I prefer mystery

Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind come help me be free
Like the shimmering stars all smiling at me, oh-oh
Pour the red wine, red wine
Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind come help me be free
With your shivering hands, yeah, put them on me, oh-oh
And pour the red wine, red wine, baby
And pour the red wine, red wine, baby

I don't care for the truth boy
You can be who you please
I've had enough of reality
And longing for the sweet relief, oh oh

And I'm in love with the rush boy, love with the rush boy
You wouldn't believe
And right now, we're no one
So baby, let's breathe

All the girls all around the world are sayin'
"Boy I need love, I need action, action"
And all the guys all around the world are sayin'
"Everyone crave a distraction, don't you?"

Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind, come help me be free
Like the shimmering stars all smiling at me, oh-oh
Pour the red wine, red wine
Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind come help me be free
With your shivering hands, yeah, put them on me, oh-oh
And pour the red wine, red wine, baby
And pour the red wine, red wine

I, I wanna linger wanna live out all my fantasies
Dance on every table 'til they're mad at me
Throw my hair back in the breeze
Boy, you're right there with me
Should believe, gold summer breeze
Don't roll eyes at me
Trying to stop me from flying, but I won't
No, no
Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey
Pour the red wine, red wine

Feeling like a loose leaf stuck on the tree
Blowing in the wind, come help me be free
Take your shivering hands, yeah, put them on me, oh-oh
And pour the red wine, red wine, baby
And pour the red wine, red wine, baby

(All the girls all around the world are sayin')
Pour the red wine, red wine baby
(And all the guys all around the world are sayin')
Pour the red wine, red wine baby
(All the girls all around the world are sayin')
Pour the red wine, red wine baby
(And all the guys all around the world are sayin')
Pour the red wine, red wine baby
