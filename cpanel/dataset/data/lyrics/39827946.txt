Nowhere shining
Look the poor boy crying
A hole where I can hide in
May never get to find it
Dead horse riding
From the Milan to the Mayan
He took a bullet from a tyrant
Can you give me some asylum
Whiteboy
Where you going, whiteboy?
Whiteboy
Where you going, whiteboy?
Whiteboy
Where you going, whiteboy?
Where you going, whiteboy?
Get him, get him
With your boys
And all the bullies and the noise
Fight or flight, got no choice
Where you going, whiteboy?
Where you going, whiteboy?
Whiteboy
Whiteboy
Whiteboy
