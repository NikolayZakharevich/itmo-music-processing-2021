Watch out, watch out!
Watch out, watch out!
Empty streets and distant voices
Approaching steps give you no choices
You cannot hide you gotta run
Give up the fight it cannot be won
You’re on you’re own
You’d better
Watch out, look out
It’s right in your footsteps
Watch out, right now
It’s breathing on your neck
When you look behind
No one’s around
It tricks your mind
You’d better watch out, watch out!
Watch out, watch out!
You don’t know where it’s coming from
You try to see, it’s already gone
And late at night outside your house
You hear a sound but no one is around
You’re on your own
You’d better
Watch out, look out
It’s right in your footsteps
Watch out, right now
It’s breathing on your neck
When you look behind
No one’s around
It tricks your mind
You’d better watch out, watch out, watch out!
Wherever you look, it’s out of your sight
It’s like the mirror of your inner fright
Is it real or make believe
It follows, follows you
Watch out, watch out!
Watch out, watch out!
You’d better
Watch out, look out
It’s right in your footsteps
Watch out, right now
It’s breathing on your neck
When you look behind
No one’s around
It tricks your mind
You’d better
Watch out, look out
It’s right in your footsteps
Watch out, right now
It’s breathing on your neck
When you look behind
No one’s around
It tricks your mind
You’d better watch out, watch out, watch out!
