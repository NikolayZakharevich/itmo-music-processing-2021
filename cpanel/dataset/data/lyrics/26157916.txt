Scout Lace Harding
Swift and cunning
Her arrows cut you
Down to size
Scout Lace Harding
Taut bow taunting
Life so light
Will flee your eyes
Born of the ground
Loyal and sound
Inquisition bound
Scout Lace Harding
Battle’s calling
Inquisition’s bloody prize
Scout Lace Harding
Smile at warning
Smirk at fear
And laugh in their eyes
Born of the ground
Loyal and sound
Inquisition bound
Scout Lace Harding
Without warning
Makes men fall
Like tarnished crowns
What can be said
To all who have fled
The dwarf with the freckled face?
But all who remained
To stand in her way
Met with her arrow’s fate
Scout Lace Harding
Swift and cunning
Her arrows cut you
Down to size
Scout Lace Harding
Battle’s calling
Inquisition’s bloody priz
Scout Lace Harding
Smile at warning
Smirk at fear
And laugh in thir eyes
Born of the ground
Loyal and sound
Inquisition bound
Scout Lace Harding
Swift and cunning
Her arrows cut you
Down to size
