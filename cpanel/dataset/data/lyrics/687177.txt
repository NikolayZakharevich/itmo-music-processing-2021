Sound is the same for all the world
Everybody has a heart
Everybody gets a feeling
Let’s play!
Sound box!
Rock, reggae, jazz, mbalax
All around the world, the same
Pachanga, soul music, rhythm and blues,
The same
La samba, la rumba, cha-cha-cha,
The same
Sound is the same for all the world
Everybody has a heart
Everybody gets a feeling
Mbaqanga, ziglibiti, high life music,
The same
Merengue, funk, Chinese music,
The same
Bossa nova, soul makossa, rap music,
The same
Come on people, dance
Everybody in the world has a culture
Believe what you believe
Respect your customs
Everybody must do what the heart says
Don’t cause trouble
Treat people well
Be sociable
Exchange ideas
Music is the same the world over
Musicians, too, are cut from the same cloth
We’re aiming to entertain you
