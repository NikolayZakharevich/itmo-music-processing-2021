You know Bluey had to cook this up
Karltin!

We just want justice
From cops that just don't trust us
Bitch please, we ain't really fuckin' with no bitch police
And if you don't like it, you can sit on these
Know a better way to keep my wrist on freeze
And they just profilin'
From skin color to cloth stylin'
And they just throw sirens
And hope that we go silent
And if you don't, then they show violence

And there's another brother in a wooden box
Laid out in dress clothes
Shot by policemen, you know how the rest goes
Every time I turn around
I turn around, there's another brother in a wooden box
Laid out in dress clothes
Shot by policemen, you know how the rest goes
Every time I turn around
I see another mother's mascara rainin' down

And we just want justice
From cops that just want bust us
Bitch please, we ain't sayin' nothin' to the bitch police
Snitchin' where I'm coming from will get you pieced
We ain't doin' nothing, why must I freeze?
If you wanna search me, you can frisk on these
You just profilin', yeah
You just pro-violence but there'll be no silence
While you're blinded by your views you can throw sirens
See me on the news, there'll be no violins

Just another brother in a wooden box
Laid out in dress clothes
Shot by policemen, you know how the rest goes
Every time I turn around
I turn around, it's another brother in a wooden box
Laid out in dress clothes
Shot by policemen, you know how the rest goes
Every time I turn around
I see another mother's mascara rainin' down

Every time I turn around, mmm
