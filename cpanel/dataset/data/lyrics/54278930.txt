Something something is about to happen
I feel it in my heart a thumping
I’m fired up my thoughts are spinning
This could be what I’ve been waiting
Waiting for someone to deliver
Saving bottle caps forever
Now I’m running to the door to answer
I really should know better

I’ve been here before with my arms apart
Like a maestro waiting for his show to start
Oh be still, oh be still ruby heart

Hear it, hear it on the tracks it’s coming
Put a glass against the wall, she’s singing
She’s putting on a dress to meet me
There a whisper in the trees a blowing
A promise of a new beginning
This could be why I’ve been waiting
This could be my second coming
I really should know better

I’ve been here before with my arms apart
Like a maestro waiting for his show to start
Oh be still, oh be still ruby heart
Oh be still, oh be still ruby heart
Oh be still till you know what you got

Oh be still, oh be still ruby heart
Oh be still, oh be still ruby heart
Oh be still, oh be still ruby heart
