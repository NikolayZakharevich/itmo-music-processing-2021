Late night
Call you in the late night
Trade love for one night
Two pills and the red wine
I don't mind
The words that you don't say
No love when you hold me
No calling the next day
It's a one way, no

And now the sun is up, I'm coming down
(Nobody no way, I'm nobody no way)
We just blow it up, blow it out

Sex money feelings die
Baby don't you cry
Sex money feelings die
Baby don't you cry
Sex money feelings die
Ladies on my right
Sex money feelings die
(Sex money feelings die)
Sex money feelings die

Oh I'm afraid that the sunlight
I don't get if you're alright
Two lines, one time
Every night, every weekend, weeknight
All my lights off when I wake up
Tears under my makeup
Your lips will stay shut
Wanna wake up, breakup

I don't wanna think about, think about you
Drink up, drink up
I'm so fucked up
All I want is you
No, I don't wanna think about, think about you
Drink up, drink up
I'm so fucked up

Sex money feelings die
Baby don't you cry
Sex money feelings die
Baby don't you cry
Sex money feelings die
Ladies on my right
Sex money feelings die
(Sex money feelings die)
Sex money feelings die

All night, all night, all night
All of these nights, sex money lies
All night, all night, all night, ooh...
All night, all night, all night
All of these nights, sex money lies

Sex money feelings die
Baby don't you cry
Sex money feelings die
Baby don't you cry
Sex money feelings die
Ladies on my right
Sex money feelings die
(Sex money feelings die)
Sex money feelings die
Baby don't you cry
Sex money feelings die
Baby don't you cry
Sex money feelings die
Ladies on my right
Sex money feelings die
(Sex money feelings die)
Sex money feelings die
